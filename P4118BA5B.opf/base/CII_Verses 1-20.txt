1 He who excels in religious teachings and its purpose (dharmārtha), qualities (guṇa), and knowledge
(jñāna), who is complete pure, impeccable, pure from his origin, and stainless, who
is placed anywhere (apratiṣṭhita) like space (gaganasama) and unmoving (aniñjya), who is
of extreme depth (gambhīra) and beyond any range (agocara), I bow to him.

2 Victorious One (jīna) whose absolute body (dharmakāya) is same as the manifested (prabhāvita)
body, displayed the handsome (abhirūpa) body as endowed with the beautiful form (surūpa),
having produced (prajanita) the compassion (karuṇā) which brings benefits for living beings
(satvānugrāhaka), reveals the supreme body which has the characters of hundredfold merits
(śatapuṇyalakṣaṇāni).

3 You never say erroneous (nirvikalpa) words and sentences (śabdavacana). Having known the essential
character of sentence cannot be grasped because it is like an echo, also having known
[the essential character of] words and letters (akṣara) cannot be grasped because they
are not eternal (anitya), Loving One, you speak the teaching of the Victorious One by great
compassion.

4 You understand (adhigama) the thought and the contents of thought (cittacaitta) of all living
beings (sarvasatva), know the essential character of mind (citta) and the stream of thought
(cittadhārā) which are like an illusion (māyā), and your mind is not dependent on thought,
mind, and consciousness (cittamanovijñāna)

5 When you teach your practice (caryā) to living beings (jagat), there is no change in the body
of the Sugata.But still, you teach in a manner in accordance with the power of retaining
[in memory], the thinking, the qualities, characteristics and behavior (īryāpatha) [of
you listeners].

6 [Because] the concept of mine (mamakāra) does not exist in the dharma of the Sugata, you neither
depend (āśrita) nor hold (agrāha) on the dharma.But having known the discipline (vinaya)
for all kinds of beings through conceptions (saṃkalpa) of the dharma, you always teach
the peerless (annutara) dharma.

7 When the whole assembly regard the body of the Victorious One, his form and distinguishing
marks (rūpanimitta) appear as different (bhinna), though incomparable (atulya), and even
not part of any particular group (asabhāga).And even though his body is changeless (nirvikāra),
beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpa), and without distinguishing marks (animitta),
he gladdens the assemblies in accordance with their particular way of thinking and their
intentions (yathācittāśaya).

8 These all dharmas, having been born from causes and conditions (hetupratyaya), produced by
thought-constructions (saṃkalpa) are not produced (asaṃskāra), without an intrinsic nature
(asvabhāva).Still the Sugata, having known the mode (naya) of such dharmas, obtained the
changeless (nirvikāra), peaceful (śānta), unsurpassable (anuttara) enlightenment.

9 Without discrimination (vikalpa) eliminating the middle (madhya) and the extremes (anta),
[you understand] emptiness, that all has a trifling instrinsic nature (riktasvabhāva), is
worthless (tuccha) and void (vaśika).Though, knowing the complete purity (viśuddhi) of such
dharmas, you explain cause (hetu) and action (karma) to living beings.

10 The dharmas are devoid of a living being (satva), a life principle (jīva), and a person (pudgala).
They are pure and beyond words (nāma) like the sameness of space (gaganasamasamatā).Understanding
the fact that there is no real self, he awakens living beings to the unconditioned
(asaṃskṛta) ambrosia (amṛta).

11 You have practised in order to seek awakening (bodhi) by the power and effort of vigour (vīryabala)
during inconceivable (acintiya) hundred koṭis of kalpas (kalpakoṭīśata).But you
still attained awakening charecterized by practice without effort, and that is how you have
obtained the aim (artha) of practice.

12 Because of the wisdom of concentration (samādhi) on the sameness of dharmas (sarvadharmasamatā),
you know the sameness of the superior, average or inferior [disciples] (hīnotkṛṣṭamadhyamasamatā,
cf. Laṅk).But staying with sameness (samatā) you do not construct (na vikḷp-)
[a concept of] sameness, the Victorious One (jīna) is concentrated (samāhita) without
change (nirvikāra).

13 The parts of the personality, spheres and fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana) are
as an illusion (māyopama); the three worlds are as the reflection of the moon in the water
(udakacandropama) without change (acyuta); all living beings are non-existence (abhāva) as
a dream (svapnopama). Having realized the fact that all things are like a dream by the knowledge,
you teach this dharma.

14 According to what is essentially a conventional expression (vyavahārasvabhāva) you attained
the supreme enlightenment (agrabodhi), but, really, that is ineffable (anudāhāra) since
there is neither attainment nor non-attainment (prāptāprāpta).You obtain the dharma wheel
as you attain awakening, but the turning is really without any distinguishing mark, and as
such the enterance into neither turning nor non-turning.

15 Having crossed over to the other side (uttīrya), you save (uttaraṇa) an inconceivable number
of living beings (bahusatva); having been released yourself (muktvā), you completely release
(vimocayasi) those still in bondage (bandhana);you care for the living beings of the
world (jagat) in this incomparable (anuttara) great vehicle (mahāyāna), you place them in
extinction (nirvāṇam pratiṣṭhāpayati), which is the sameness of being beyond any way (nairyāṇa)

16 Even though living beings nowhere and never exist, as does not extinction (nirvāṇa), even
though there is nothing for living beings to achieve since they are originally pure (ādiviśuddhi),the
Buddha still awakens (avabodhayati) koṭis of living beings (bahusatva), having
himself become awakened to the understanding that living beings have the character of an
illusion (māyā).

17 No forms are seen in empty space, the forms of every living being are also like that.The
moments of existence have the essential character of a form being neither form nor non-form
(dharmā narūpārūparūpalakṣaṇāḥ), such it is to understand things (artha) as complete transcendence
(viveka).

18 [No matter] how much living beings praise (praśaṃsita) the Victorious One (jina) by means
of examples (udāharaṇa), it is still an attachment (saṅga) that they see him with respect
to the praising.Because the qualities (svaguṇa) of the Leader (nāyaka) are like empty space
(gagamasama), the praising for non-duality (advaya) is to praise the Victorious One.

19 The Buddha who awakens (prabodhayati) living beings, transcends objectification (anālambana),
and attains the nature of mind (cittatva) which is without mind, I pay homage to him.As
all leaders (nāyaka) praise (praśaṃsanti) the Lion Among Men (nṛsiṃha), in that way, I
praise the true qualities (bhūtaguṇa) because of suchness (tathatā).

20 He knows all living beings have egolessness (nairātmya), the sphere of dharmas of the Omniscient
(viśvabodhi) has the same character, and the character of all dharmas is free from
desire (virāga). Because of that, the Leader (nāyaka) having sameness (samatā) is honored.

As soon as (samanantara) the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja said these verses (śloka),
the pavilions in the sky of the Mahāvyūha universe has been shaken (pracalita) in six
ways (ṣaḍartha).Then a voice resounded from empty space (antarīkṣa), saying, “The bodhisatva,
the great being Gaganagañja has praised in verses (gāthābhigīta) the complete unsurpassable
awakening (anuttarāsamyakṣaṃbodhi) which has been fully accomplished by the buddhas
in uncountable hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of ages (asaṃkhyeyakalpakoṭīniyutaśatasahasrasamudānīta).But
these bodhisatvas cannot see this [awakening] as object (ālambana)
even in their dreams (svapna) because of their attachment (abhiniveśa).Having heard, attained
and believed in this teaching of the dharma (dharmanaya), whosoever will gradually
attain the lion’s roar (siṃhanādanādi) like that of bodhisatva Gaganagañja.”Then the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja, having praised the Lord with these verses, addressed himself to the Lord
(atha gaganagañjo bodhisatvo gāthābhir abhiṣṭutya bhagavantam idam avocat):O Lord, I, having
heard the name of this exposition of religion, a chapter of the Great Collection (aham
apy bhagavan mahāsaṃnipātaparivartaṃ dharmaparyāyaṃ nāma śrutvā), arrived in this Sahā world
system (lokadhātu), to see, honor, serve the Lord and to [listen] this exposition of
religion (taṃ bhagavantaṃ darśanāya vandanāya paryupāsanāya dharmaśravaṇāya), and also I came
here (ihāgata) to perform the light of dharma (dharmāloka).O Lord, please elucidate (saṃdeśayatu)
this exposition of religion to these good men (satpuruṣa) who have a doubt (saṃśaya)
in their respective religions (svakeṣu svakeṣu dharmeṣu). May the Blessed Tathāgata
please cut off their all doubts (sarvasaṃśaya) and illuminate all qualities of the Buddha
(sarvabuddhadharma) since you are established (pratiṣṭhita) in the ascertainment (niścaya)
in your mind (buddhi).
