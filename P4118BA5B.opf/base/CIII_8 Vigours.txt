Son of good family, these are eight pure vigours of bodhisatvas. What are the eight?a) vigour
to adorn his body (kāyālaṃkāra) but the body is not the objective support since it is distinguished
(vikalpita) as a reflection (pratibimba);b) vigour to accomplish proper speech
(vāgabhisaṃskāra) although the speech cannot be perceived since it is distinguished as voidness
(vaśika);c) vigour to put the thought (citta) into the state of concentration (samādhi)
although the thought is not the objective support since it is imagined by the true state
of thought (cittadharmatā);d) vigour to attain all aspects of perfection (pāramitā) although
they cannot be perceived since they are imagined by the true nature of dharma (dharmatā)
which is the extinction of the continuous succession of thought (cittaparaṃparā);e)
vigour to attain all dharmas that are wings of awakening (sarvabodhipakṣyadharmasamudgama)
although the awakening is not perceived (na samanupaś-) since it is distinguished as the
essential character (bhāvalakṣaṇa);f) vigour to purify Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra) although
the fields are not perceived since they are distinguished as empty space;g) vigour to retain
all learning (sarvaśrutadhāraṇa) while regarding (samanupaśyat) the sound (śabda) as
an echo (pratiśrutkā);h) vigour to accomplish all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma)
although they are not the objective support since they are distinguished as the homogeneity
of absolute reality (dharmadhātvasaṃbheda) by nature (lakṣaṇa);Son of good family,
those eight are the pure vigours of the bodhisatvas.
