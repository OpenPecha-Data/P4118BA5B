Śāriputra, the bodhisatva, the great being, Gaganagañja is blessed with (adhiṣṭhita)
the display of appearances (avabhāsa) like this.O Śāriputra, the bodhisatva, the
great being, Gaganagañja is coming here to see, praise, serve (darśanavandanaparyupāsana)
me, and attain this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya), a chapter of the Great Collection
(mahāsaṃnipātaparivarta). Also he is coming with the assembly of all bodhisatvas who
have gathered from the worlds of the ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu) for the sake of the
joy of religion (dharmaprītā), happiness (sukha), the source of great joy (prāmodyasamudaya),
the upholding of the great vehicle (parigrahamahāyana), and the wings of awakening (bodhipakṣika)
of all bodhisatvas.[In the Mahāvyūha universe, just after,] the bodhisatva, the
great being Gaganagañja, accompanied by, encircled (parivṛta) and followed (puraskṛta)
by twelve koṭis of bodhisatvas, said to the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha: “I would like to go to
the world Sahā to honour the Buddha Śākyamuni. I wish to see him and listen to him. Then
that Buddha said: “I will grant your wish.” The bodhisatva Gaganagañja touched the feet of
the Buddha Ekaratnavyūha, and circumambulated him.Then, by the supernatural display (ṛddhyabhisaṃskāra),
by the miraculous performances (vikrīḍita) of the [Ekaratnavyūha] Buddha,
[Gaganagañja with the other bodhisatvas] teleported from the Mahāvyūha universe to this Saha
universe (mahāvyūhalokadhātau antarhitaḥ sahālokadhātau prātiṣṭhata), in one moment of
thought (ekacittakaṣana), and sat down there.They showered flowers, garlands, powders, perfumes,
unguents, parasols, banners, flags (puṣpamālyacūrṇagandhavilepanacchatradhvajapatākā)
from the Mahāvyūha universe pouring down as rain (varṣābhipravarṣaka).To wit, the moon
flower, the great moon flower, the most beautiful moon flower, the sun-light flower (sūryaprabha),
the sun-shining flower, the sun-loved flower (sūryakānta) flower, the fair-colored
flower (roca), the great fair-colored flower (mahāroca), the brightening-colored flower,
the Sthāla flower (sthāla), the great Sthāla flower (mahāsthāla), the beautiful Sthāla flower,
the undefiled flower, the impeccable flower, the pure-light flower, the golden-light
flower, the space-light flower, the tangible flower, the white great fragrance flower, the
non-anther flower, the Aśoka flower (aśoka), the Cadamba flower (nandaka), the golden bark
tree flower, the source of happiness flower, the satisfaction of body and mind flower,
the one billion fragrances flower, the herbal flower, and the medicinal flower.[The flowers]
were adorned with their own splendor and were and produced by immeasurable merits (aprameyapuṇya)
and known by bodhisatvas of the ten directions. The great three-thousand thousands
of worlds were covered (saṃchādayati) with those flowers, and all congregations of the
Lord were filled with flowers up to their knees (puṣpajānumātra).Then the whole assembly
(sarvāvatī parṣat), having seen the flowers which have never seen or heard before (adṛṣṭāśrutapūrva),
addressed themselves to the Lord:"O Lord, where are such beautiful flowers coming
from? (kuto bhagavann imāni evaṃrūpāṇi darśanīyāni puṣpāṇi āgacchanti)"The Lord said
(bhagavān āha), “O son of good family (kulaputra), the bodhisatva, the great being, Gaganagañja,
having come from the Mahāvyūha universe, brought down such rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa).”Then
the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja together with the twelve koṭis of bodhisatvas,
having descended from the vault of the sky, bowed down at the feet of the Buddha,
circumambulated him three times, and addressed himself to the Lord. (atha gaganagañjo
bodhisatvo mahāsatvas tābhir dvādaśair bodhisatvakoṭibhiḥ saha gaganatalād avatīrya bhagavataḥ
pādau śirobhir vanditvā tripradakṣiṇīkṛṭya bhagavantam etad avocat)“O Lord, the tathāgata,
Ekaratnavyūha asked after your health - if you have little trouble, little discomfort,
and little unrest; if you are strong, and living in touch with supreme happiness (bhagavan
tathāgata ekaratnavyūho ’lpābādhatāṃ ca paripṛcchaty alpātaṅkatāṃ ca laghutthānatāṃ ca
yātrāṃ ca balaṃ ca sukhaṃ cānavadyatāṃ ca sparśavihāratāṃ ca).And he said that the bodhisatva,
the great being Gaganagañja and the twelve koṭis of bodhisatvas had wanted to hear about
(śrotukāma) the exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya), a chapter of the Great Collection
(mahāsannipātaparivarta), so please be kind to let them thus return when they are empowered
by all such dharmas and equipped with the words of dharma.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
sustained (adhiṣṭhita) the jewel-canopy (ratnacchattra) of ten thousand yojanas high
over the Lord’s lion throne in the space, joined the palms of his hands (añjali), bowed
down to the Lord (abhivandana), and praised the Lord with these suitable verses (etābhir
gāthābhiḥ sārūpyābhir abhiṣṭūya),
