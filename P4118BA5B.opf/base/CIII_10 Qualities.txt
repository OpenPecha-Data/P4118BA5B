To wit, a) the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā) as the summit (mūrdhan) of all perfections
(sarvapāramitā);b) the supernormal knowledge without retrogression [as the summit] of
all supernormal knowledges (sarvābhijñā);c) the stage of consecration (abhiṣekabhūmi) [as
the summit] of all stages (sarvabhūmi);d) the right view (samyagdṛṣṭi) and concentration
(samādhi) without retrogression [as the summit] all wings of awakening (sarvabodhipakṣikadharma);e)
the meaning and eloquence without obstruction (anācchedyārthapratibhāna) [as the
summit] of special knowledges (pratisaṃvid);f) the way into unattached knowledge (asaṅgajñānapraveśa)
[as the summit] of all knowledges (sarvajñāna);g) the knowledge of understanding
superior, mediocre, and inferior (hīnamadhyaviśiṣṭapraveśajñāna) [as the summit] of all
his faculties (sarvendriya);h) following the knowledge of light (ābhāsajñānānugamana) [as
the summit] of power and fearlessness (balavaiśāradya);i) the sight of the Buddha (buddhacakṣur),
seeing all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma) as being in the palm of his
hand (karatalagata), [as the summit] of all kinds of sights (sarvacakṣur);j) the perfect
awakening (abhisaṃbodhi) through insight (prajñā) associated with a moment of thought (ekacittakṣaṇasamāyukta)
[as the summit] after sitting on the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍaniṣadana)
- they recollect such ten qualities as the summit.This recollection is not disturbed
by any particular viewpoint (dṛṣṭi), manifestations of bad dispositions (anuśayaparyutthāna),
mental efforts (manasikāra), or discursive thinking (prapañca), so there is no impurity
(anāvila) and thus the recollection of gods is, son of good family, called the recollection
of gods, which is authorized by the Lord.

15. BodhisatvacaryāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva perform his practice of
a bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā) after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā)?The
extinction (nirvāṇa) is the pacification of all vices (sarvakleśapraśamana),the
allaying of every feeling (sarvavedanāpratipraśrambhaṇa),the pacification of all objects
(sarvālambanapraśamana),and no connection (pratisaṃdhi) with the parts of personality, spheres
or fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana).Thus the good man (satpuruṣa), having obtained
the sameness of extiction (nirvāṇasamatā), playfully employs (vikrīḍita) the great
compassion (mahākaruṇā), means and insight (prajñopāya), and knowledge (jñāna) of the former
lives (pūrvanivāsa);he is sustained by the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhitai);he
cultivates insight (prajñā) and knowledge (jñāna);he purifies cultivation (bhavānā)
by means of the clear presence of manifestation (bhāvānapariśuddhi);he depends on concentration
(samādhi) which is the miraculous play (vikrīḍita) with illusion (māyā);The vices
by which he might produce existence and bonds of existence, these he does away with (yaiḥ
kleśaḥ saṃsāraṃ saṃsārabandhanaṃ vā prabhāvayati tān prajahāti), and the knowledge by
means of which he teaches extinction, in that he excels (yena jñānena nirvāṇaṃ deśayati tatra
vaśitāprāptaḥ), thus he is born from non-existence and originated form non-origination
(anutpādotpanno ’bhūtabhūtaḥ).Even though he is established in the sameness of extinction
(nirvāṇasamatāsaṃprasthita), he still does not interrupt bringing living beings to maturity
(satvaparipāka).This, son of good family, is the gate of knowledge (jñānamukha), called
the development of two approaches (yamakapariṇāma), [namely the great compassion (mahākāruṇā)
and expedient means (upāya)] of the bodhisatvas, and even though the bodhisatva is placed
in the gate of knowledge after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā),
he still performs the practice of a bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā).

16. CaritalakṣaṇaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva know1 the essential character
of behaviour of all living beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇa)?There, son of good family,
are eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour of living beings (caturaśītisatvacaritasahasra),
and these are the basic words of a summary (mūloddānapada).The behaviour of all living
beings, which is immeasureable (sarvasatvacaritāpramāṇa), unthinkable (acintya), and ineffable
(anabhilāpya), is known by the knowledge of a Buddha (buddhajñāna), but not by the
knowledge of the disciples, the isolated buddhas (śrāvakapratyekabuddhajñāna), or the knowledge
of bodhisatva (bodhisatvajñāna).Thus the bodhisatva penetrates the essential character
of behaviour of all living beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇānupraveśa) through the presence
of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhāna) and his own knowledge (ātmajñāna).The behaviour’s essence
(svabhāva), essential character (lakṣaṇa), the essential character of cause (hetulakṣaṇa),
the essential character of condition (pratyayalakṣaṇa), the essential character of productive
cause (karaṇahetulakṣaṇa), the essential character of combination (sāmagrīlakṣaṇa),
the essential character of difference (nānātvalakṣaṇa), the essential character of discordance
(vilakṣaṇa), the essential character of passion (rāgalakṣaṇa), the essential character
of aversion (dveṣalakṣaṇa), the essential character of delusion (mohalakṣaṇa), the essential
character of the three together (sabhāgalakṣaṇa), the essential character of hell-beings
(nirayalakṣaṇa), the animal world (tiryagyonilakṣaṇa), the essential character of the
world of the lord of death (yamalokalakṣaṇa), the essential character of gods (devalakṣaṇa),
the essential character of human being (manuṣyalakṣaṇa), the essential character of
the entrance into the fixed course of disciples (śrāvakaniyāmāvakranti), the essential character
of the entrance into the fixed course of isolated buddhas (pratyekabuddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa),
the essential character of the entrance into the fixed course of the buddhas (buddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa),
the essential character of distant cause, the essential character of intermediate
cause (anantaryalakṣaṇa), and the essential character of immediate cause - he knows
all the essential characters of behaviour truly as they are (yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti), and
there is no fault at all (anavadya) in his understanding (sarvajñāna).

17. DharmaratnanidhānaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva grasp the treasury of
the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords?Son of good family, the treasury
of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords is imperishable (akṣaya).Thus,
as many as are the entrances into the essential character of behaviour in all living
beings, so many are the entrances into knowledge which is the gate into the treasury of
the Dharma Jewel of the Awakened Lords (yāvantaḥ sarvasatvānāṃ caritalakṣaṇānupraveśās tāvad
api buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānamukhajñānapraveśāḥ).Just as the behaviour
of living beings is imperishable and endless, in the same way, the treasury of the Dharma
Jewel of the Awakened Lords is also imperishable and endless (yathā satvacaritam akṣayam anatam
evam api buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānāny akṣayāṇi anatāni).From the night
(rātri) when the Tathāgata attained awakening (bodhiprāpta) to the night of his extinction
(parinirvāṇa), the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) has been explained,
is being explained, and will be explained by the Tathāgata. All of them are what they really
are (tathatā), not different from what they are (avitathatā), and nothing else but what
they are (ananyathā).Why is it called ‘such’ (kasmāt tatheti)? Since it is the entrance into
the peace of suchness, it is called 'such’ (tathatāśāntisaṃprasthitatvāt tatheti).Why
is it called ‘suchness without error’ (kasmāt avitatheti)? Since it is the entrance into the
highest truth, it is called ‘suchness without error.’ (paramārthasatyasaṃprasthitatvāt
tatheti)Why is it called ‘suchness that is not other’ (kasmāt ananyatatheti)? Since he seeks
nothing else but the essential nature (svabhāva), there is no other.Further, as for the
treasury of the Dharma Jewels of the Awakened Lords, even though living beings of a system
of threefold thousand great thousand worlds (trisāhasramahāsahasralokadhātuparyāpanna) were
as learned as (bāhuśruta) Ānanda, all of them would not be able to understand even a syllable
(akṣara) in hundreds of thousands of millions of aeons (kalpakoṭīśatasahasra); and
further they would not be able to teach even a single meaning (ekārtha) - such a true teaching
(yathābhūtadeśanā) is the treasury of Dharma Jewels belonging to the Awakened Lords.The
bodhisatvas, having grasped it, do not forget (saṃpramoṣayati) any letter or lose any
meaning (artha), and they please (ārādhyati) all living beings, gratify (ārāgayati) all the
Buddhas, vanquish all the Evil Ones (sarvamāra), subjugate all other heretics (sarvānyatīrthika),
and appease all vices (sarvakleśa). Thus they understand the Dharma Jewel Words.In
this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva grasps the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna)
of the Awakened Lords.

18. DharmasvabhāvaBut further, son of good family, in the perspective of the essential character
of the dharma (dharmasvabhāva), the bodhisatva may grasp an essential character, thinking:
“I have fully understood (abhisambuddha) the dharmas.”But, how then has the Tathāgata
understood (abhisaṃbuddha) the dharmas?[It is like this:] their nature is [like] illusion
(māyāsvabhāva) because it is not established in reality (apariniṣpanna);their nature is
[like] a dream (svapna) because it transcends perceptual fields (viṣayātikrantatarayogena);their
nature is [like] a mirage (marīci) because there is no birth (atyantānutpanna);their
nature is [like] a reflected image (pratibhāsa) because it is unchanging (asaṃkrānti);their
nature is [like] a reflection (pratibimba) because it is devoid of intrinsic nature (niḥsvabhāva);their
nature is empty (sūnya) because it is dependent (aparādhīna);their nature
is without distinguishing mark (animitta) because it is beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpa);their
nature is wishless (apraṇihita) because it is not attached to thoughts (cittāsaṅga);their
nature has no desire (rāga) because it is free from all desires (sarvarāgavigata);their
nature is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta) because there is no any calculation (asaṃkhya).Thus,
son of good family, based on the information (prajñapti) in conventional expressions
(vyavahāra) of others I was fully awakened (abhisaṃbuddha) to such dharmas,but still,
their essential character (dharmasvabhāvalakṣaṇa) is inexpressible in words.Even though
the bodhisattva, who wishes to grasp the dharmas, is fully awakened to dharmas with such
an essential character, he still teaches other beings (parasatvapudgala) by means of syllables
and explanations of language (akṣaranirukti).

19. SatvādiviśuddhiHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva bring all living beings
to maturity (paripācayati) given the fact that they are originally pure (satvādiviśuddhi).The
realm of living beings (satvadhātu), son of good family, is originally pure (ādiviśuddhi),
and thus their roots have no basis (avastuka).The bodhisatva, son of good family, having
understood that the roots of all dharmas are completely cut off, brings living beings
to maturity, and then he does not hold the view of a self (ātmadṛṣṭi), the view of a living
being (satvadṛṣṭi), the view of a life principle (jīvadṛṣṭi), or the view of a person (pudgaladṛṣṭi).Again
he thinks (punas tasyaivaṃ bhavati): “what is called ‘living being (satva)’
is a misunderstanding (viparyasta). Because of being occupied (paryavasthāna) with the
view of cause (hetudṛṣṭi), ignorance (avidyā), existence (bhāva), thirst (tṛṣṇā), and unreal
mental constructions (abhūtaparikalpa), it is called ‘living being.’”But the bodhisatva
still teaches the Dharma (dharmaṃ deśayati) to living beings in order to get rid of vices
which originate from misunderstanding (viparyāsasamutthitakleśaprahāṇa), and he does not
forget (na vipraṇāśayati) substances (bhāva).Since he is devoid of a living being (niḥsatva),
and detached from a living being (satvaviveka), he brings living beings to maturity.Thus
the bodhisatva brings living beings to maturity (sarvasatvān paripācayati) by the original
purity (ādiviśuddhi).

20. DharmaprayogaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva collect all qualities of
the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmasamudānaya) by thorough practice (yoniśaḥprayoga)?‘Thorough (yoniśaḥ)’
means the entrance into dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśa). Why is
that?As is the cause and conditions (hetupratyaya), thus the fruit (phala) is produced (abhinirvṛtta).The
generosity (dāna) is the cause of great comforts (mahābhogahetu),and the
bodhisatva, having transferred that giving into omniscience (tyāgaṃ sarvajñatāyaṃ pariṇāmaitvā),
fulfils the perfection of giving (dānapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The morality (śīla) is
the cause of birth among gods and men (devamānuṣajātihetu),and the bodhisatva, being born
among gods and men, makes living beings adopt moral ways (śīlam avatārayati);he, having
transferred the maintaining morality into omniscience, fulfils the perfection of morality
(śīlapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The tolerance and mildness (kṣāntisauratya) are the causes which
are the ornaments of body, speech and thought (kāyavākcittālaṃkārahetu);the bodhisatva
practices what is good for oneself and for others (ātmaparahita) through the ornaments of
body, speech and thought (kāyavākcittālaṃkāra);he, having transferred the basis of wishing
to help and tolerance into omniscience (hitakāmakṣāntyavasthāṃ sarvajñatāyaṃ pariṇāmaitvā),
fulfils the perfection of tolerance (kṣāntipāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The vigour (vīrya)
is the cause of collecting all Buddha learning (sarvabuddhaśruta);The bodhisatva makes an
effort (vīryam ārambya), attains all roots of good (kuśalamūlaṃ samādāpya), transfers the
vigour of attaining all roots of good into omniscience, and fulfils the perfection of vigour
(vīryapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The meditation (dhyāna) is the cause of happiness and noble
birth (pramuditacittājāneyahetu);the bodhisatva completes the accumulations for peaceful
meditation (śamathasaṃbhāra) with happiness and noble birth (pramuditacittājāneya);he, having
transferred the accumulations of peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāra) into omniscience,
fulfils the perfection of meditation (dhyānapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).Learning (śruta)
is the cause of great insight (mahāprājñahetu);the bodhisatva, not being entangled in the
preconceived viewpoints (upalaṃbhadṛṣṭikāgrahaṇa), having transferred the learning without
apprehending (anupalambhaśruta) into omniscience, fulfils the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitāṃ
paripūrayati).In the same way with all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharma), whatever
the cause of good qualities (kuśaladharmahetu) accumulated, its effect (phala) will
appear without effort (anābhoga).Further, the cause and conditions (hetupratyaya) are called
thorough mental effort (yoniśomanasikāra).With regard to what is called ‘thorough (yoniśaḥ)’,
there is the self in every fundamental moment of existence.Just as there is no self
in oneself, so there is no self in any moment of existence.Just as the self is empty (śūnya),
so all moments of existence are empty.Just as the self is merely a word (nāma), so all
moments of existence are merely words.Thus the thorough practice (yoniśaḥprayoga) of the
bodhisatva is to be equally associated with all moments of existence.That which is the same
as all moments of existence (sarvadharmasamatā) is the same as all qualities of the Buddha
(sarvabuddhadharmasamatā), and thus the thorough practice of the bodhisatva is to attain
the qualities of the Buddha (buddhadharma).

21. AcyutābhijñāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva never lose his supernormal
knowledge (acyutābhijñā) after having attained the mastery of all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya)?Son
of good family, if a certain ascetic or a brahmin (kulaputraśramaṇabrāhmaṇa) produces
the supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) without having overcome the view that there is
a permanent substance (satkāyadṛṣṭi), he will loose his supernormal knowledge.However the
bodhisatva, having overcome sixty-two doctrinal viewpoints (dvāṣaṣṭidṛṣṭigata) derived from
the root view that there is a permanent substance (satkāyadṛṣṭimūla), produces the supernormal
knowledge in the absence of any attachment of view;he is endowed with knowledge (jñānavān),
insight (prajñāvān), consciousness (buddhivān), tolerance (kṣāntivān), morality (śīlavān);he,
having entered into concentration, is detached from body and mind (kāyacittavivikta);he
approaches his inner and does not move around his outer through such knowledge
(jñāna);he is endowed with the object that there is no object;he is endowed with disciplined
thoughts (ājāneyacitta) and joyous thoughts;he examines [things] by means of thorough examination
(suniścita);he has supremely pure consciousness which is not disturbed by vices
(kleśa), having attained the light (ālokalabdha).there is no obstruction (vitimira) in his
knowledge (jñāna);he accumulates merits (puṇyasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates knowledge (jñānasaṃbhāropacaya);he
accumulates peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates
expanded vision (vipaśyanasaṃbhāropacaya);he is stabilized by his generosity (dāna);he
is adorned with morality (śīlālaṃkṛta);he is clad in the armor of tolerance (kṣāntisaṃnāha);he
is equipped with the mail of effort (vīrya);he is established in meditation (dhyānapratiṣṭhita);he
is endowed with the consciousness that cultivates insight (prajñāsubhāvita);he
is in accordance with friendliness (maitrī);he is established in compassion (karuṇāpratiṣṭhita);he
has realized through skillful means (upāyābhinirhṛta);he produces the supernormal
knowledge (abhijñā) because he is endowed with such a dharma;he, having been elevated
into the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa) by the supernormal knowledges, attains the mastery
of all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya) by the supernormal knowledges;he, having seen all
forms (sarvarūpadarśana), having heard all words (sarvaśabdaśravaṇa), and having entered
into the whole thought (sarvacittapraveśa), recollects innumerable aeons (asaṃkhyeyakalpa);having
obtained miracle (vikurvaṇa) which is the cessation of the sullied states (āsravakṣaya)
through all his magical powers (sarvarddhi), he attains the mastery of all considerations
(vyavacāra) with discrimination (vikalpa) as much as there is the discrimination of
mind (manas);and thus, according to the all dharmas, he is established in non-effort (anābhoga).In
that way, son of good family, the bodhisatva never turns back from his supernormal
knowledges (acyutābhijñā) controls all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya).

22. DharmanayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva enter into the profound guiding
principle of the dharma (gambhīradharmanayapraveśa) which is difficult for disciples and
isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddha) to understand (prativedhya)?What is called
‘profound (gambhīra),’ son of good family, is the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda).The
way of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanaya) is like this: formative factors
are caused by ignorance; consciousness is caused by formative factors; name and form are
caused by consciousness; the six fields of sense-perception is caused by name and form;
touch is caused by the six fields of sense-perception; feeling is caused by touch; thirst
is caused by feeling; grasping is caused by thirst; existence is caused by grasping; birth
is caused by existence; ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression, and
despair are caused by birth. Thus this great mass of utter suffering originates.(yad uta

saṃbhavaṃty evam asya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya
samudayo bhavati)What are the causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) for the vices (saṃkleśa)
of living beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, this is called the guiding
principle of the origin of the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādasamudayanaya).What
then is the guiding principle of the cessation of the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya)?To
wit, cessation of formative factors is caused by cessation of ignorance
comes; cessation of consciousness is caused by cessation of formative factors; cessation
of name and form is caused by cessation of consciousness; cessation of the six fields
of sense-perception is caused by cessation of name and form; cessation of touch is caused
by cessation of the six fields of sense-perception; cessation of feeling is caused by cessation
of touch; cessation of thirst is caused by cessation of feeling; cessation of grasping
is caused by cessation of thirst; cessation of existence is caused by cessation of grasping;
cessation of birth is caused by cessation of existence comes; cessation of ageing,
death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression and despair is caused by cessation of
birth. Thus this great mass of utter suffering ceases.(yad uta avidyānirodhāt saṃskāranirodhaḥ,

duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati evam asya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati)This,
son of good family, is the guiding principle of dependent origination ceasing (pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya).What
are the causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) for the purification
(vyavadāna) of living beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, though
any disciple or isolated buddha [cannot enter], this is called the entrance into the
profound guiding principle of dharma.Why is that? Because both the vices of all living beings
and the knowledge of purification (sarvasatvakleśavyavadānajñāna) belong to the sphere
of the Awakened Lords (buddhagacara),and the bodhisatva understands these connetions (anusaṃdhi)
by his own knowledge (ātmajñāna) and the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhāna).Further,
what we called ‘profound (gambhīra)’ is concerned with essential entities (satkāya).As
the self is pure (ātmaviśuddhi), thus all dharmas are pure (sarvadharmaviśuddhi).Why?
If you really search for essential entities (satkāya), they can never be grasped (nopalabhyante).That
which can never be grasped is ‘profound (gambhīra).’The self has never been
grasped by any buddha.Why is that?The self is originally pure (ādiviśuddha), and just as
the self is pure, so all dharmas are pure.Why do we say ‘pure (viśuddha)’?Since any dharma
is unoriginated (anutpanna) and beyond origination (anutpāda), not ceased (aniruddha), and
beyond cessation (anirodha), it is called ‘pure (viśuddha).’In what is beyond darkness (andhakāra),
beyond manifestation (anābhāsa), without basis (anālaya) and blindness (timira),
in what is the deep and highest truth (gaṃbhīraparamārtha), there is no sight (cakṣur)
or cessation of sight, up to and including no mind (manas) or cessation of mind, that is the
space of objects (gocara) where there is no calculation (gaṇanā).That which makes the space
of objects (gocara), being a space without objects, that is the highest truth (paramārtha),
and that is why it is called ‘profound (gambhīra).’Because it cannot be grasped by
thought and mind (acittamanogrāhya), it is difficult to understand (duradhigamya), difficult
to see (durdṛśya), and difficult to comprehend (duḥprativedhya). But he, not dependent
on others in respect of knowledge (jñānāparapraṇeya), still teaches this profound guiding
principle of dharma to other living beings (parasatvān gambhīradharmanayaṃ pradeśayati),This
is the entrance into the profound guiding principle of dharma (gambhīradharmanayapraveśa)
of the bodhisatva, which is hard for disciples and isolated buddhas to fathom (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhaduravagāha).

23. Pratītyasamutpādagaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 3Son of good family, how does the bodhisatva
become skilled in knowing the entrance into the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala),
and become free from two extreme views (sarvāntadvayadṛṣṭivivarjita)?.Son
of good family, the bodhisatva should think like this (iha bodhisatvasyaivaṃ bhavati):that
on which there is dependence, that is nothing in particular (yat pratītya tat kiṃcin
nāsti);that on which there is dependence, that is inexistent (yat pratītya so ’bhāvaḥ);that
on which there is dependence, that is not being established in reality (yat pratītya
tad apariniṣpannam);that on which there is dependent origination, that is impermanence, suffering,
selflessness and quiescence (yat pratītyasaṃutpannaṃ tad anityaduḥkhānātmaśāntam);in
the dependent origination, there is no self, no being, no life-principle, no life-sustaining
principle, no spirit, no personality, no human being, no man (na satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);in
the dependent origination there is no attainment (samudgama);in the
dependent origination there is nothing, and it is effortless (avyāyāma), empty (śūnya),
no distinguishing mark (animitta), transcendent (viveka), no activity (apracāra), no discursive
thinking (aprapañca), and thus beyond discursive thinking (niṣprapañca).Thus origination
(jāti) is just the arising of the dharma, and cessation (nirodha) is also the ceasing
of the dharma.Therefore it is said that there is no self, being, life-principle, life-sustaining
principle, spirit, personality, human being, or man (satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);In
the dharmas which are dependently originated there is no true origination (jāti)
and there is no owner (svāmika).Because of that, all dharmas are like grass, trees,
walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsasadṛśa).Just as there is nothing
that produces external things when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases
external things when they cease, just so, there is nothing that produces internal things
when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases internal things when they cease;But
rather, when conditions (pratyaya) exist they will arise, and when conditions are completely
exhausted they will be destroyed.”If you understand this knowledge in that way,
you will overcome any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).What then are extreme views (antadṛṣṭi)?‘Extreme
(anta)’ means discontinuity (uccheda) and continuity (nitya), and that which is
not originated and ceased is beyond discontinuity and continuity and thus pure, and therefore
it is purified when concerned with any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).In that way, son of
good family, the bodhisatva becomes skilled in knowing the entrance into the dependent origination
(pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala) and free from any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).

24. TathāgatamudrāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva become skilled in knowing
suchness without any differentiation (tathatāvinirbhāgajñānakuśala) as sealed with the seal
of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita)?With regard to what we called ‘being sealed with
the seal of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita),’ suchness without any differentiation
(tathatāvinirbhāga) is the seal, and it is without distinction, activity (apravṛtti), attachment
(abhiniveśa), agitating, or being agitated, and thus it cannot be shaken (na kampayituṃ
śakyate) by the world with its gods, humans, or anti-gods (sadevamānuṣāsureṇa lokena).Why?
The world with its gods, humans and anti-gods is indeed sealed with that seal,and
the seal of the tathāgata is the seal which is unoriginated, empty (śūnyatā), signless (animitta),
wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), free from desire (virāga), just
as it is (tathatā), the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), and open space (gagana).Just as the
seal in the empty space (gaganamudrā) does not appear, the seal of the tathāgata does not
appear to even the five kinds of sight as it is sealed by the seal having its own essential
character (svalakṣaṇamudrāmudrita).All the explanations about the dharma and the pertaining
conventions (dharmavyavahāra) given by the tathāgata are sealed with the seal of the
tathāgata in that way.Among them, those which pertain to the sphere of consciousness establish
the dharma;but those which are not established in consciousness do not establish any
dharma, and do not differentiate between any dharma;those which are sealed with the seal
of the tathāgata do not differentiate suchness (tathatā).What then is the differentiation
of suchness (nānātathatā)?It is those which differentiate (kalpayanti) the dharmas of superior,
mediocre, and inferior (hīnamadhyaviśiṣṭa),those, which do not construct any dharma
and do not make any differentiation, do not differentiate suchness,and, no matter how many
things are imagined and constructed (kalpitavikalpita), they do not differentiate suchness.Just
like all living beings wander about in empty space, the sphere of empty space (gaganadhātu)
is not connected with them, in that way, all living beings wander about in suchness,
but they do not tarnish suchness.And here, the bodhisatva who can understand such dharmas
is sealed with the seal of the tathāgata, and he does not tarnish suchness.

25. DharmadhātuHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva relate to the guiding principle
of the sphere of moments of existence (dharmadhātunaya), being united with (samavasarati)
the sphere of all moments of existence (sarvadharmadhātu)?‘The sphere of moments of existence
(dharmadhātu)’ is the sphere that is free from desire since it is free from any impurity
(rāgavigatadhātuḥ sarvarajavigatatayā?);the sphere of non-origination (anutpanna)
since it is not something in particular (asamudānīta);the sphere without cessation (anirodha)
since there is no occurrence;the sphere that does not go anywhere (agamanatā) since there
is no transmigration (gamana);the sphere without coming (anāgamanatā) since there is no
passing over;the sphere without abiding since there is no arising;the sphere as it really
is (yathāvaddharmadhātu) because of its sameness in all three times (tryadhvasamatā);the
sphere of self (ātmadhātu) since it is originally pure (ādiviśuddhi);2the sphere without
personality (niḥpudgaladhātu) since it is the highest truth (paramārtha);the sphere without
information (avijñāptidhātu) since it is non-abiding;the sphere without basis (anālayadhātu)
since there is no contamination (saṃkīrṇa);the sphere without birth (anutpādadhātu) since
it is fixed (niyāma);the sphere like the space (gaganadhātu) since it is essentially
tranquil (svabhāva_pariśuddhi);the sphere of liberation (nirvāṇadhātu) since there is no argument
against it (apratipakṣa);such is the entrance into the way of the sphere of moments
of existence (dharmadhātunayapreveśa).Since all moments of existence are like this, son
of good family, if the bodhisatva enteres into the way of moments of existence, then, whatever
he says, expresses, or teaches, all that is united with (samavasṛta) the sphere of moments
of existence.Having entered into the way of the sphere of moments of existence, he knows
the fact that there is no duality of the sphere of desire and the moments of existence
(rāgadhātudharmadhātu)- why? - because the desire (rāga) has the nature of the sphere of
all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of aversion (dveṣadhātu) and the
sphere of moments of existence - why? - because aversion has the nature of the sphere of
all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of delusion (mohadhātu) and the
sphere of moments of existence - why? -because delusion has the nature of all moments of
existence;there is no duality of the sphere of vices (kleśadhātu) and the sphere of moments
of existence - why? - because vices has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there
is no duality of the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu) and the sphere of moments
of existence - why? - because passion has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there
is no duality of the sphere of forms (rūpadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence
- why? - because forms has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there
is no duality of the sphere without form (ārūpyadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence
- why? - because the formlessness has the nature of the sphere of all moments of
existence;there is no duality of the sphere of the eye (cakṣurdhātu) and the sphere of moments
of existence - why? - because the eye has the nature of the sphere of all moments of
existence;there is no duality of the sphere of forms (rūpadhātu) and the sphere of moments
of existence - why? - because forms has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there
is no duality of the sphere of eye-consciousness (cakṣurvijñānadhātu) and the sphere
of moments of existence - why? - because eye-consciousness has the nature of the sphere
of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere in the interval of mind and
the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the sphere of mind has the nature of
the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of mind-consciousness
(manovijñānadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the sphere
of mind-consciousness has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is
no duality of the sphere of aggregates (skandhadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence
- why? - because the sphere of aggregates has the nature of the sphere of all moments
of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of earth, water, fire or wind (pṛthivīdhātvabdhātutejodhātuvāyudhātu)
and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the earth,
water, fire or wind has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is
no duality of the eighty-four thousand masses of religious teaching (caturaśītidharmaskandhasahasranirdeśa),
the eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour (caturaśītisahasracaritāna)
or all moments of existence (sarvadharma) and the sphere of all moments of existence - why?
- because all moments of existence have the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence.The
bodhisatva knows all moments of existence since the moments of existence which is
the entrance into the sameness (samatāpraveśa) is united with all moments of existence.
Son of good family, this is the entering into the way of moments of existence of the bodhisatva.

26. DṛḍavajrāśayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva with a resolve firm and unbrekable
(dṛḍhābhedyāśaya) like the diamond (yathāvajra) become well established (susthita)
and unwavering (aniñjya) in this great way?Son of good family, when the bodhisatva is unbreakable
(abhedya) having made a resolve as firm as a diamond with the twelve qualities,
he is not disturbed by the world with its gods (sadevakena lokena). What are those twelve
(katamāni dvādaśa)?To wit, a) since the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), intention (āśaya),
and determination (adhyāśaya) are unbreakable (abhedya), the practice (prayoga) is also
unbreakable;b) the generosity (dāna) is unbreakable, and the morality, tolerance, vigour,
meditation, and insight (dānaśīlakṣāntivīryadhyānaprajñā) are unbreakable;c) great friendliness
(mahāmaitrī) and great compassion (mahākaruṇa) are unbreakable;d) the way of attraction
(saṃgrahavastu) is unbreakable;e) bringing living beings to maturity (satvaparipācana)
is unbreakable;f) the purification of the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetrapariśuddhi) is unbreakable;g)
indefatigability in existence (saṃsārāparikheda) is unbreakable;f) non-satisfaction
for the root of good (kuśalamūlātṛpti) is unbreakable;g) endless offerings (atyantayajña)
for the sake of obtaining the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty
(lakṣaṇānuvyañjana) are unbreakable;h) giving up body and life in order to uphold the true
religion (saddharmaparigrahāya kāyajīvitaparityāgaḥ) is unbreakable;i) dedicating his roots
of good (kuśalamūlapariṇāmana) for the sake of other beings (parasatvapudgala) is unbreakable;j)
his accumulation of all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmasamudānaya)
is unbreakable.When the qualities of bodhisatva are unbreakable in that way, son of good family,
he is unbreakable having made a resolve as firm as a diamond (dṛḍhavajrāśaya).Just
as a diamond (maṇiratnavajra) breaks any kind of gem without being broken itself, so the bodhisatva,
having made a resolve as firm as a diamond, removes bad habits, manifestations
of vices, and wrong views (anuśayakleśaparyutthānadṛṣṭigata) of all living beings, but still
he himself is not broken because of this great vehicle (mahāyāna).In this way, son of good
family, the bodhisatva is unbreakable having made a resolves as firm as a diamond, being
well established and unshakable in this great way.

27. BuddhaviṣayaHow then, son of good family, does the own realm (svaviṣaya) of the bodhisatva
become pure, when he has attained the realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)?‘The realm of
the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)’ is not a realm, and since it is non-realm, it is purified of any
realm.Thus the bodhisatva purifies his own sphere (svaviṣaya) by the purity of the sphere
of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayapariśuddhi), and he thinks: “the realm of sight (cakṣurviṣaya)
is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.”Why
is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm (vivekaviṣaya),
and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of sight.The realm of hearing (śrotraviṣaya)
is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness
or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm,
and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of hearing.The realm of smelling (ghrāṇaviṣaya)
is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or
farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and
the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of smelling.The realm of tasting (jihvāviṣaya)
is the realm of the Buddha, in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why
is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent
realm is beyond the realm of tasting.The realm of touching (kāyaviṣaya) is the realm
of the Buddha, in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that?
This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent
realm is beyond the realm of touching.The realm of mind (manoviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha,
and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is
because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is
beyond the realm of mind.It is the same case with the parts of personality, spheres, fields
of sense perception, (skandhadhātvāyatana) and the twelve links of dependent origination
(dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva enters into
every realm as transcendent, and belonging to the realm of the Buddha.Entering into the
field of the Buddha (buddhakṣetrapraveśa) by the purity of his own field (svakṣetrapariśuddhi)
is the following: All the moments of existence appearing in his six sense organs (ṣaḍindriya),
all those he enters as being transcendent as realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayaviveka).Just
as the realm of the Tathāgata (tathāgataviṣaya) is unattached and unobstructed,
so there is no attachment or obstruction in all realms.In this way, son of good family, the
bodhisatva, entering into the realm of the Buddha, purifies his own realm.

28. DhāraṇīHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva who has attained memory never forget
(tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya dhāraṇīpratilabdhasya ’saṃpramoṣacaryā)?Son of
good family, the bodhisatva attains memory (dhāraṇī) by purifying his memory (dhāraṇīpariśodhana).
