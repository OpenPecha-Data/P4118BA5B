Cāturmahārāja

Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, please give the tathāgata’s
blessing over this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) so that, in the latter time,
in the latter age (paścimakāle paścimasamaye), it will be disseminated and practiced
throughout the Jambūdvīpa.”The Lord said: “For that reason, son of good family, I will invoke
the Four Great Kings (cāturmahārāja) so that they will come and strive to keep this exposition
of religion for a long time (dharmaparyāyacirasthti) with detailed and analytical
explanation (vistaravibhāganirdeśa).These are the words for invoking: tadyathā | dhudhure
| dhidhire | dhvajavati | dhvajālaṃkāre | āvartani | śame śamavati | śāntimukhe | nigrahaparapakṣa
| anuttara | uttaravigama | samapatha | pathaśuddhi | pathānugama | pathasandhi
| prajñāmukhe | āryakule | bhūtarakṣa ame sacca mene sacca tama sacca tatama sacca | buddhapāda
| dharmānusandhi | āryagaṇānugama | āryanirghātani | ruṣṭaprāsādani | īśvarapadalokacittikṛte
| anurāgayantu | imān dharmasandhi | vibhajantu nirukte | nirdeśe pratirakṣantu
| dharmadhāraṇī |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the Four Great Kings.”Then
the Four Great Kings, having become scared and fearful (bhayabhīṭa), approached the
Lord, prostrated themselves at the Lord’s feet, and said this to the Lord:“O Lord, we, the
Four Great Kings will protect, shield, guard (rakṣāvaraṇagupti) this exposition of religion
(dharmaparyāya) so that it may last long and be beneficial.Wherever this exposition of
religion is practiced, if there are devas, nāgas, yakśas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas or
kiṃnaras (devanāgayakṣagandharvāsuragaruḍakinnara) who want the destruction of the dharma,
we will subjugate them.Whosoever seek for the dharma, we will make them happy.We will offer
hospitality to the congregation of the dharma-reciter (dharmabhāṇakaparṣanmaṇḍala), never
forget the meaning of the words to be connected to the words (padānusaṃdhyasaṃpramoṣatā),
give inspiration (pratibhāna), and increase recollection, intelligence, understanding and
happiness (smṛtimatiprativedhamuditā).At these words, the Lord said this to the Four Great
Kings: “Excellent, excellent, friends, you are my sons born of the dharma, and all of
you demonstrate the effort to uphold my true dharma (saddharmaparigraha). With the outcome
of the dharma (dharmaniṣyanda) all of you will be the masters of the world in this world,
and after having transcended all the world, you will attain the final extinction (nirvāṇa)
in the realm of noble extinction (āryanirvāṇadhātu).”
