Prabhāvyūha

At that time, the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha, being surrounded and followed (parivṛta) by sixty-eight
hundred thousand Brahmās, teleported from the world of Brahmā to the presence of the Lord
(brahmaloke antarhitaḥ bhagavato ’ntike prātiṣṭhata), bowed down at his feet (bhagavataḥ
pādau śirobhir vanditvā), circumambulated him three times (tripradakṣiṇīkṛṭya), and sat down
on a side.Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, the greatness
(māhātmya) of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s morality, concentration, supernormal knowledge,
knowledge, insight, fulfilling vows, skillful means, highest intention, mastery of
the dharma, ornaments for body, speech and thought, and mastery over all dharmas (śīlasamādhyabhijñājñānaprajñāpraṇidhānaparipūraṇopāyakauśalādhyāśayadharmeśvarakāyavākcittālaṃkārasarvadharmavaśitā)
are marvelous (āścarya)!Since the bodhisatva Gaganagañja has purified his
former activities, he manifests all activities by body, speech, and thought without any
effort. O Lord, since his former roots of good (pūrvakuśalamūla) have been not yet repaid
by anyone, that the bodhisatva Gaganagañja roars this lion’s roar (siṃhanādanādi) in the
present time is the outcome of the profound practice in the past.”The Lord said: “Quite so,
it is just as you have said. The incomparable complete awakening of the bodhisatvas arises
from the former roots of good, merits, and knowledges (pūrvakuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then
the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the root of good of the bodhisatvas,
what is the merit, what is the knowledge?”The Lord said: “Brahmā, ‘the root of
good (kuśalamūla)’ is the initial resolution to strive for awakening (prathamacittotpādika),
and the root of all qualities of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmamūla);‘merit (puṇya)’ is,
as soon as the thought of awakening is produced, to conquer all items of meritorious action
consisting in generosity, morality, and meditational self-cultivation of all disciples
and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhānāṃ dānamayaṃ śīlamayaṃ bhāvanāmayaṃ sarvapunyakriyāvastvabhibhāvana);‘knowledge

this way, Brahmā, the bodhisatva arises from the root of good,
merit, and knowledge (kuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the
Lord: “It is a marvelous, Lord, that the tathāgata explains all sorts of qualities of the
buddha (sarvabuddhadharmanānātva) by means of these three root words [or stages] (mūlapada).”At
these words, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said to the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha: “Brahmā,
everything is included in a single word (ekapadasamavasṛta).Why is that? The word ‘emptiness
(śūnyatā)’ is a single word, and everything is included in emptiness;the word ‘signlessness
(ānimitta)’ is a single word, and everything is included in signlessness;the word ‘wishlessness
(apraṇihita)’ is a single word, and everything is included in wishlessness;in the
same manner, the words ‘the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskāra), non-desire (virāga), peace
(śānti), non-basis (anālaya), the absolute truth (dharmadhātu), suchness (tathatā), the limit
of reality (bhūtakoṭi), inexistence (asaṃbhava), and unbornness (anutpāda), each of them
is a single word, [and everything is included in them];the word ‘extinction (nirvāṇa)’
is a single word, and everything is included in extinction.Further, Brahmā, desire (rāga)
is a word for non-desire. Why? Because desire is the essence of non-desire (virāgasvabhāva).
Thus everything is included in the essence of desire (rāgasvabhāva).Aversion (dveṣa) is
a word for non-aversion (adveṣa). Why? Because aversion is the essence of non- aversion (aveṣasvabhāva).
Thus everything is the essence of aversion.Bewilderment (moha) is a word for
non-bewilderment (amoha). Why? Because bewilderment is the essence of non-bewilderment
(amohasvabhāva). Thus everything is the essence of bewilderment.Aggregation of perishable
things (satkāya) is a word for no aggregation of perishable things. Why? Because aggregation
of perishable things is the essence of no aggregation of perishable things. Thus everything
is the essence of aggregation of perishable things.Form (rūpa) is a word for the absence
of form. Why? Because form is the essence of absence of form. Thus everything is the essence
of form.In the same way, feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are words for the absence of feeling, perception, formative factors
or consciousness. Why? Because feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness
are the essence of absence of them. Thus everything is the essence of feeling, perception,
formative factors and consciousness.It is the same for fields, sense perceptions (dhātvāyatana),
and the twelve links of dependent origination (dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).Ignorance
(avidyā) is a word for the absence of ignorance. Why? Because ignorance is the essence
of the absence of ignorance, all dharmas of the buddha are the essence of ignorance.Birth
is a word for no birth (anutpāda). Why? Because birth is the essence of no birth, all
dharmas of the buddha are the essence of birth.All teachings of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharma)
is a word for no teaching (adharma). Why? Because everything is the essence of no
thought-construction (avikalpa), all teachings of the buddha are the essence of all teachings.Brahmā,
those are the door of entering into a word for dharma called (dharmapada) ‘the
entrance into the word without word (apadapadapraveśa)’ in which all dharmas of the buddha
are included in one single word.Just as, Brahmā, all streams flow into the great ocean (mahāsāgara),
just so all qualities of the buddha are included in a single word ‘the entrance
into the dharma (dharmamukha).’Just as, Brahmā, all manifestations of forms (sarvarūpāvabhāsa)
appear in open space, just so all teachings of the buddha are included in a single
word, thus this word is the inexhaustible word and the word which is split into one hundred
thousand.Just as, Brahmā, even though all of one hundred thousand are included in a single
word which is split into one hundred thousand, and even though those have been removed
after having been split for a thousand years, the muchness of one hundred thousand is neither
established in the connection with that word nor connected to ‘one hundred thousand,’
just so, Brahmā, while calculating and measuring to split the qualities of the buddha for
many hundreds of thousands of aeons, the qualities of the buddha are never experienced by
body or thought, thus those are impossible to be explained and too much to be explained.Further,
muchness is non-muchness. Why is that? If someone obtained so much or not so much,
it would be just as much as he obtained because there is no muchness or non-muchness. Thus
it is impossible to say that it is much or not much.Brahmā, calculating the dharmas of the
buddha is calculating all dharmas. Why is that? Because all dharmas are the dharmas of
the buddha, and the dharmas of the buddha are neither the dharmas nor non-dharmas.Why is that?
The dharmas of the buddha cannot be mentally constructed (parikalpita) by perception
(saṃjñā), or rather, those are taught in order to fully know the perception. Thus the thought-construction
(parikalpa) that there is neither perception nor non-perception is neither
the dharma nor the non-dharma.Brahmā, since the dharmas of the buddha have such an essential
character (lakṣaṇa), by their own essential character, they are pure and transcendent
(svalakṣaṇapariśuddhasvalakṣaṇavivikta).Since own essential character (svalakṣaṇa) is the
absence of essential character (alakṣaṇa), the open space has no essential character and
it is characterized as all dharmas.When this religious discourse was given by the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja, twelve thousand Brahmās in the assembly produced the thought of the incomparable
complete awakening, and five thousand Brahmās, who had planted the well prepared roots
of good (parikarmāvaropitakuśalamūla), attained the tolerance that all things are unborn
(anutpattikadharmakṣānti).
