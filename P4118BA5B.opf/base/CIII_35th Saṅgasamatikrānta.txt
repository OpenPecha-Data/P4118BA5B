35. SaṅgasamatikramaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva transcend all attachments
(sarvasaṅgasamatikrama)?What is called ‘attachment’ means the manifestation of viewpoints
(dṛṣṭiparyutthāna) on the dharmas.The bodhisatva transcends all attachments since he is
free from any manifestation of viewpoints (dṛṣṭiparyutthāna).Just as the wind (vāyu) is
not attached to the vault of the sky, so the bodhisatva who is endowed with the wind-like
thought is not attached to any living being.
