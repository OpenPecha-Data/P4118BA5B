19. SatvādiviśuddhiHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva bring all living beings
to maturity (paripācayati) given the fact that they are originally pure (satvādiviśuddhi).The
realm of living beings (satvadhātu), son of good family, is originally pure (ādiviśuddhi),
and thus their roots have no basis (avastuka).The bodhisatva, son of good family, having
understood that the roots of all dharmas are completely cut off, brings living beings
to maturity, and then he does not hold the view of a self (ātmadṛṣṭi), the view of a living
being (satvadṛṣṭi), the view of a life principle (jīvadṛṣṭi), or the view of a person (pudgaladṛṣṭi).Again
he thinks (punas tasyaivaṃ bhavati): “what is called ‘living being (satva)’
is a misunderstanding (viparyasta). Because of being occupied (paryavasthāna) with the
view of cause (hetudṛṣṭi), ignorance (avidyā), existence (bhāva), thirst (tṛṣṇā), and unreal
mental constructions (abhūtaparikalpa), it is called ‘living being.’”But the bodhisatva
still teaches the Dharma (dharmaṃ deśayati) to living beings in order to get rid of vices
which originate from misunderstanding (viparyāsasamutthitakleśaprahāṇa), and he does not
forget (na vipraṇāśayati) substances (bhāva).Since he is devoid of a living being (niḥsatva),
and detached from a living being (satvaviveka), he brings living beings to maturity.Thus
the bodhisatva brings living beings to maturity (sarvasatvān paripācayati) by the original
purity (ādiviśuddhi).
