21. AcyutābhijñāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva never lose his supernormal
knowledge (acyutābhijñā) after having attained the mastery of all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya)?Son
of good family, if a certain ascetic or a brahmin (kulaputraśramaṇabrāhmaṇa) produces
the supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) without having overcome the view that there is
a permanent substance (satkāyadṛṣṭi), he will loose his supernormal knowledge.However the
bodhisatva, having overcome sixty-two doctrinal viewpoints (dvāṣaṣṭidṛṣṭigata) derived from
the root view that there is a permanent substance (satkāyadṛṣṭimūla), produces the supernormal
knowledge in the absence of any attachment of view;he is endowed with knowledge (jñānavān),
insight (prajñāvān), consciousness (buddhivān), tolerance (kṣāntivān), morality (śīlavān);he,
having entered into concentration, is detached from body and mind (kāyacittavivikta);he
approaches his inner and does not move around his outer through such knowledge
(jñāna);he is endowed with the object that there is no object;he is endowed with disciplined
thoughts (ājāneyacitta) and joyous thoughts;he examines [things] by means of thorough examination
(suniścita);he has supremely pure consciousness which is not disturbed by vices
(kleśa), having attained the light (ālokalabdha).there is no obstruction (vitimira) in his
knowledge (jñāna);he accumulates merits (puṇyasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates knowledge (jñānasaṃbhāropacaya);he
accumulates peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates
expanded vision (vipaśyanasaṃbhāropacaya);he is stabilized by his generosity (dāna);he
is adorned with morality (śīlālaṃkṛta);he is clad in the armor of tolerance (kṣāntisaṃnāha);he
is equipped with the mail of effort (vīrya);he is established in meditation (dhyānapratiṣṭhita);he
is endowed with the consciousness that cultivates insight (prajñāsubhāvita);he
is in accordance with friendliness (maitrī);he is established in compassion (karuṇāpratiṣṭhita);he
has realized through skillful means (upāyābhinirhṛta);he produces the supernormal
knowledge (abhijñā) because he is endowed with such a dharma;he, having been elevated
into the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa) by the supernormal knowledges, attains the mastery
of all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya) by the supernormal knowledges;he, having seen all
forms (sarvarūpadarśana), having heard all words (sarvaśabdaśravaṇa), and having entered
into the whole thought (sarvacittapraveśa), recollects innumerable aeons (asaṃkhyeyakalpa);having
obtained miracle (vikurvaṇa) which is the cessation of the sullied states (āsravakṣaya)
through all his magical powers (sarvarddhi), he attains the mastery of all considerations
(vyavacāra) with discrimination (vikalpa) as much as there is the discrimination of
mind (manas);and thus, according to the all dharmas, he is established in non-effort (anābhoga).In
that way, son of good family, the bodhisatva never turns back from his supernormal
knowledges (acyutābhijñā) controls all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya).
