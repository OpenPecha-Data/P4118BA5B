119 The nature of the dharma (dharmasvabhāva) is empty (śūnya), just as an illusion (māyā),
and we did not know the essence of the dharma (dharmalakṣaṇa) before. But you gave magically
created husbands to us, thereby we were matured in the highest vehicle (agrayāna).120 Since
all these dharmas are magically created, they are already empty, without movement or
activity. By fully understanding the uncontaminated knowledge (anāsravajñāna), from this time
forth, we will never get into the power of vices (kleśavaśa).121 We will produce the thought
of the highest awakening (agrabodhicitta), and take care of all living beings. Just
as you poured down the magnificent on living beings, we will pour down the rain of the highest
dharma (agradharmavarṣa).122 The Sage (muni), the highest leader (agranāyaka), predicted
for them: “In the future, when you completed your practice, you will become supreme conquerors
(jinendra), the well-gone ones (sugata) called Suvinīta.”

AbhayadānaAt that time, there were five hundred men who were in danger of being killed [by robbers.]
When they were led to their death, a voice resonated in open space: “You should do
homage to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, who provides fearlessness (abhaya) to the frightened,
then you will be saved from death.”Then all those, terrified with the fear of death, said
together in one voice: “Homage to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (namo gaganagañjāya
bodhisatvāya mahāsatvāya)!”In that very moment, five hundred men, having descended
from the open space and arrived at that place, said this to robbers (vadhakapuruṣa):“Why
do you kill these poor men? Kill us, take our clothes and ornaments, and set them free.”Then
the robbers released the five hundred men to be killed because of vices caused by their
greed, and killed the magically created men.Then they, freed from the robbers, found
their relief (āśvāsana) from the fear and terror (bhayabhīṭa) of being killed, went to the
place where the bodhisatva Gaganagañja stayed, bowed down at the feet of the Buddha, joined
the palms of their hands (añjali), bowed to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, and said:“We survived
and found relief because of you, O Good man (satpuruṣa), please teach us the dharma
which is the entrance into development for myself and others, because one can make progress
in the dharma.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Sons of good family, you should conceive
the incomparable complete awakening (utpādayata idānīm anuttarāyāṃ samyakṣaṃbodhau cittam),
in this way, you can practice what is benefit for yourselves and for others (ātmahitaparahita).”Thus
addressed, they generated the thought of incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi),
and offered a hundred thousand calico clothes (duṣya) to the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja.Then, saying “Friends, let us also offer this calico clothes to the Lord,”
all those offered calico clothes for the body of the Lord.Thereupon the Lord prophesied:
“After incalculable aeons, when you achieved the way of the dharma which are wings of awakening
(sarvabodhipakṣikadharmanaya), all of you will appear in this world as the tathāgatas
called Abhayadāna.”

Śāriputra

Then the venerable Śāriputra addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja (atha khalu āyuṣmañ
śāriputro gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvam etad avocat): “After you established this treasury
in the inexhaustible, imperishable, and permanent open space, son of good family, how long
will it be continued?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Śāriputra, do you think the open space
will be exhausted and destroyed, then disappear?”Śāriputra replied: “No indeed, son of good
family.”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Śāriputra, in the same way awakening has the essential
character of open space (tathā śāriputra bodhir gaganasvabhāvalakṣaṇā), and, in the
case, my roots of good are transformed into that. This is the reason why this treasury of
open space (gaganagañja) is inexhaustible, imperishable, and permanent.Again, as for your
question regarding how long this treasury will be continued after having been established
in open space, it will be continued as long as the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), generated
by me, will be continued.Śāriputra asked: “Son of good family, how long will the thought
of awakening (bodhicitta) be continued after having been generated by you?”Gaganagañja
answered: “It is known by the knowledge of the Tathāgata (tathāgatajñāna).”The Śāriputra
the Elder addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu sthaviraḥ śāriputrao bhagavantam etad
avocat): “O Lord, how long the thought of awakening (bodhicitta) will be continued after
the bodhisatva Gaganagañja produced it?”The Lord said: “If the Tathāgata teaches this subject
(sthāna), all of the world including the gods (sadevaloka) will be confused (pramatta).Śāriputra
said: “O Lord, there are many living beings in this assembly who are very thoughtful
(pratyavekṣaṇābahula) and faithful, so please teach us.”The Lord said: “It is like this,
Śāriputra, as if the world-spheres as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā
(gaṅgānadīvālukopama) are filled with the atomic-sized dust of buddha-fields as numerous
as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, as if all the atomic-sized dust (paramāṇurajas)
is put into a single dust grain of a field during many hundreds of thousands of aeons, in
the same way of calculating and establishing distinguishing marks (gaṇanānimittapratiṣṭhāpana),
even though all the dust would be exhausted, the thought of incomparable complete
awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi), which was produced by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, for
the uncountable hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of ages (asaṃkhyeyakalpakoṭīniyutaśatasahasra),
would never be exhausted (parikṣi-).”Śāriputra said: “O Lord, What is the name
of the tathāgata when the thought of awakening was produced by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
for the first time?”The Lord said: “At the time, Śāriputra, the tathāgata Sarvapraṇidhānaratnatejobhyugatāryarāja,
worthy of offerings, the perfectly awakened one, perfect in wisdom
and conduct, a sugata, a knower of the world, a charioteer of human beings to be tamed,
unsurpassable, a teacher of gods and men, a buddha, a blessed one appeared in the aeon
called Ratnavyūha, in the universe called Sarvabuddhakṣetradarśana (tena ca śāriputra kālena
tena samayena sarvapraṇidhānaratnatejobhyugatāryarājo nāma tathāgato ’rhan samyakṣaṃbuddho
vidyācaraṇasaṃpannaḥ sugato lokavid anuttaraḥ puruṣadamyasārathiḥ śāstā devamanuṣyāṇāṃ
buddho bhagavān sarvabuddhakṣetradarśane lokadhātu ratnavyūhe kalpe).Again, Śāriputra, it
is not easy to express the splendor of the virtues of that tathāgata’s buddha-field (buddhakṣetraguṇavyūha),
remaining here with a life-span of a world-age (kalpāyuṣpramāṇasthityā).Śāriputra,
the whole retinue (parṣanmaṇḍala) of that tathāgata reached to thousands of world-sphere,
and the congregation of the bodhisatvas (bodhisatvasaṃgha) was incalculable.And,
Śāriputra, a universal king (cakravartirāja) called Sarvadevābhiṣeka appeared in three-thousandfold
universe (trisāhasra), who had a inconceivable treasury of jewels (acintyaratnagañja).He
had ninety six thousand sons who were spontaneously generated (upapāduka) by
his own majesty (svatejas).Why is that? Because there has been not even the concept of woman
in that buddha-field.Śāriputra, that tathāgata lived for one hundred thousand aeons.At
that time, the king Sarvadevābhiṣeka had paid homage and respect to the Lord for forty internal
aeons (antarakalpa), making offerings of a heap of jewels (ratnarāśi), as much as Mount
Sumeru, every single day.By the firmness of his merits (puṇya), the king, his sons, his
village’s people and retinues generated the thought of incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).Śāriputra,
[if you think that,] at that time, the universal king Sarvadevābhiṣeka
was a someone else, you should not think so (na khalu punar evaṃ draṣṭavyam).Why
is that? It is the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, who, during that period of time, was the
Sarvadevābhiṣeka, the universal king of the three-thousandfold universe (tat kasmād dhetoḥ
| gaganagañjaḥ sa bodhisatvo tena kālena samayena sarvadevābhiṣeko nāma rājābhūc cakravartī
trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātau).”Then the venerable Śāriputra addressed himself to the
Lord (atha khalu āyuṣmañ śāriputro bhagavantam etad avocat):“It is a marvelous thing, Lord,
the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, being clad in the inconceivable armour (acintyaṃ saṃnāhaṃ
saṃnaddhaḥ), has ridden in the great vehicle (mahāyāna) during that time.Lord, by such behaviour
and such dharma, he was able to obtain the great power (mahānubhāva).”The Lord said:
“Since this bodhisatva Gaganagañja paid homage and respect to the Awakened Lords as numerous
as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā (gaṅgānadīvālikāsama), Śāriputra, his thought
of awakening (bodhicitta) was purified;by purifying his thought of awakening as numerous
as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, his intention (āśaya) was purified;by purifying
his intention as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, his practice (prayoga)
was purified;by purifying his practice as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā,
his determination (adhyāśaya) was purified;by purifying his determination as numerous
as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā) was
purified;by purifying the perfection of generosity as numerous as the grains of sand in the
river Gaṅgā, the perfection of morality (śīlapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection
of morality as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection
of endurance (kṣāntipāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of endurance as numerous
as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of vigour (vīryapāramitā) was
purified;by purifying the perfection of vigour as numerous as the grains of sand in the
river Gaṅgā, the perfection of meditation (dhyānapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the
perfection of meditation as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection
of insight (prajñāpāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of insight as numerous
as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of skillful means (upāyapāramitā)
was purified;by purifying the perfection of insight as numerous as the grains of sand
in the river Gaṅgā, the unhindered thoughts and unobstructed rays of light to all beings
(sarvasatvāpratihatacittāpratihataraśmi) were purified;by purifying unhindered thoughts
and unobstructed rays of light to all beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the river
Gaṅgā, great friendliness (mahāmaitrī) was purified, thereby great compassion (mahākaruṇā),
great delight (mahāmuditā), great equanimity (mahopekṣā), and the knowledge of the great
supernormal knowledges (mahābhijñājñāna) were purified;in the same way, his bodily action,
speech, and thought (kāyavākcitta) were purified, then by purifying his thoughts as numerous
as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, one characteristic of a great man (mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇa)
was purified;and so on, up to: having purified all the thirty-two marks of a
great man (sarvadvātriṃśanmahāpuruṣalakṣaṇa), his roots of good (kuśalamūla) was purified;
by purifying his roots of good as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, this
bodhisatva Gaganagañja was purified in order to purify this treasury of open space (gaganagañjapariśodhana).Śāriputra,
this bodhisatva Gaganagañja demonstrated all those practices
of the bodhisatva (sarvabodhisatvacaryā) in the open space. And, Śāriputra, just as the open
space is imperishable, just so, by purifying all vows and practices (praṇidhānacaryā)
of this son of good family, all of them are also imperishable. Therefore it is called ‘the
treasury of open space (gaganagañja).’”When this teaching was declared (iha nirdeśe nirdiśyamāne),
a thousand bodhisatvas (bodhisatvasahasra), holding jewels of inexhaustible wealth
in their hands (akṣayabhogaratnapāṇi), produced the tolerance of fulfilling the vows of
the treasury of open space.

Dharmarāja

Then, the bodhisatva, Dharmarāja by name, addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son
of good family, let me listen to the treasury of hearing the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa) from
open space.”Gaganagañja said: “If you conceive the concept of this open space as your teacher
(śāstṛsaṃjñā), with respect and reverence (sagauravasapratīśa), son of good family,
then you will listen to the treasury of hearing the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa).”The bodhisatva
Dharmarāja and the whole congregation, having joined the palms of their hands, paid homage
to open space, and sat down.Then, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
(gaganagañjādhiṣṭhāna), these verses resonated in open space:
