165 Virtue and non-virtue previously performed will never be gone, offerings to the tathāgata
will never be gone, resolution for the thought of awakening will never be gone, and the
attainments of the most excellent learning will never be gone.166 Generosity, morality, vow
(dānaśīlasaṃvara) will never be gone, the determination to be patient will never be gone,
the application of vigour (vīryārambha) for the sake of gratefulness (kṛtajñatā) and making
good actions (kuśalakarma) will never be gone.167 The liberation of thoughts by one-pointed
meditation (ekāgradhyāna), never forgetting the profound reflection (nidhyāna) and insight
(prajñā), making actions through knowledge (jñānakarma) all the time - because of these
undisturbed dharmas, it is not difficult to attain awakening.168 One who is not sullied
by vices, who is not established in womb (garbha), and who is miraculously born is unsullied
just as a lotus does not get wet with water.169 The victorious one in the east, the
Vaidyarāja, the well-gone one (sugata) who has the highest knowledge that is unattached to
the three times (tryadhvāsaṅgajñānapara), for the sake of learning his dharma (dharmakāma),
we are coming from the nearness of Vimalaprabhā.170 Just like the flower of the Udumbara,
it is difficult to obtain the the coming of the tathāgata. In order to see and pay respect
to him, father should go to the well-gone one.171 Having heard this teaching, the king,
together with his sons, wives, retinues and hundreds of thousands creatures, proceeded to
the tathāgata.1172 Having made suitable offerings to him with flowers and perfume, they
bowed down to his feet, circumambulated him, saluted him with their hands placed together,
and then sat down before him.173 Having bowed to the feet of the tathāgata, Siṃha and Siṃhavikrāntagāmin,
the noble ones who are skilled in the meaning of the dharma (dharmārtha),
uttered these verses:174 Since you are the refuge, the protector, and the last resort (śaraṇaparāyaṇatrāṇakaraṇa),
you has become the light for the blind in the world and are expert
in knowing the thoughts and actions of living beings (satvāśayacaritakuśala). May you make
them live in accordance with their faith (yathādhimukti).175 This king longs for riches
and happiness, is captivated by form, sound, and smell, never makes any offering, and does
not even come to the nearness [of the tathāgata.] How could he hear the dharma?176 O protector,
by producing compassion, in order that all bings may listen to the highest path (agrayāna)
and never turn away from it, please teach the most excellent way of awakening (bodhipatha).177
The Lord, the protector, ascending to the height of eighty palm trees (tāla)
in the open space, said to the king: “You should listen my highest dharma, and practice
it.178 Desire is impermanent and so is kingship (rājya). Life (jīva) is like a dew-drop on
the grass (tṛṇāvaśyāyabindhūpama), and in the same way, the pleasure of passion is like a
dream. Which wise man would produce joy in this?179 Living beings are never satisfied because
of desire, and thus again and again the thirst of desire is the cause. The fool who remain
in the realm of objects (viṣaya) do not know how to be satisfied, and only those who
are satisfied with insight (prajñā) are really satisfied.180 Just as an illusion (māyā) is
deceptive and essenceless, it is taught that the five parts of the personality (pañcaskandha)
are as an illusion (māyā), these spheres (dhātu) are as a serpent-venom (āśīviṣa), the
six sense organs (ṣaḍindriya) are as an empty city (śūnyagrāma).181 Sons, wives, kingship,
or even your kingdom is not your lasting friend when you are dying; the accumulation of
disciplined sight, vow (saṃvara), and morality (śīla) are your friends who go to the other
side [with you.]182 When you see my perfect visual form (rūpa), qualities (guṇa), eloquence
(pratibhāna), and supernatural knowledges (ṛddhi), if you want to be like that, you should
produce this highest awakening.183 Having heard this teaching, the elephant-king, together
with seventy thousand koṭis of living beings, sons, wives, retinues, village people,
produced the thought of awakening.184 We will produce the supreme thought, take care of
all beings, gladly do the supreme conduct of the bodhisatva, and become unsurpassed awakened
ones.

In that way, son of good family, the king Puṇyālaṃkāra, by all sorts of offerings (sukhopadhāna)
and enjoyments (paribhoga) which were appropriate, beautiful and faultless, paid respect
to the Lord and his disciples for eighty-four thousand years.Those two boys, Siṃha and
Siṃhavikrāntagāmin, according to the teaching of the Lord, left ordinary household life behind
and became renunciants (āgārād anagārikāṃ pravrajitaḥ).”After those became renunciants,
twenty thousand princes also left ordinary household life and became renunciants.Then
the monk Siṃha and Siṃhavikrāntagāmin vigorously applied themselves to the dharma that is
the wings of awakening (bodhipakṣikadharma), austerity (saṃlekha), and practice in solitude,
thereby they soon produced the five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā utpāditāḥ).Having
attained supernatural knowledges (abhijñā), the two explained the dharma by their own magical
power (ṛddhibala) and the power of vows (praṇidhānabala) in all world-spheres (sarvalokadhātu),
brought immeasurable and incalculable living beings to maturity, and established
them in the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).After eighty-four
thousand years, son of good family, the king Puṇyālaṃkāra proceeded to the place where the
tathāgata Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja stayed, and saw his two sons who became renunciants.Having
thus seen, he produced a contemptuous attitude (paribhavacitta) about them, thinking:
“While I have served the tathāgata through all sorts of offerings (sarvasukhopadhāna)
for eighty four thousand years, what have they done?”Then, son of good family, the tathāgata
Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja, having known the king Puṇyālaṃkāra’ thought, said this to Siṃhavikrāntagāmin:“By
teaching the power of insight (prajñā), supernatural knowledges (abhijñā),
merits (puṇya), and knowledges (jñāna), son of good family, make all the assembly happy,
outshine (dhyāmīkṛta) all abodes of Māra (sarvamārabhavana), illuminate the way of awakening
(bodhimārga), satisfy all living beings, defeat all opponents (parapravādin), light
the lamp of the dharma (dharmolkā), purify all vices (sarvakleśa), and demonstrate the
miraculous play of the bodhisatva (bodhisatvavikrīḍita)!”Then the bodhisatva Siṃhavikrāntagāmin
gently touched the open space with his hand, and just then the world system of three
thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu) was shaken in six ways.Again he gently
touched the open space with his hand, and then the sound of music played by hundreds, thousands,
millions, billions of musical instruments resonated in open space.Again he gently
touched the open space with his hand, and then the rain of flowers which has wonderful smell
and which are pleasant to touch like a soft cloth (kācilindika) poured down from open
space.Again he gently touched the open space with his hand, and just then the rain of all
sorts of jewels (ratna), enjoyments (bhoga), and entertainments (samudācāra) poured down
from the open space.Just as the rain of all kinds of requisites (pariṣkāra) poured down on
the world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu), just so the
rain of food and drink poured down.Then the tathāgata Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja said this
to the king Puṇyālaṃkāra: “With giving gifts, great king, how much amount of this rain
of jewels is falling?”Puṇyālaṃkāra replied: “O Lord, this rain of jewels is not easy to illustrate
because it is immeasurable.”The Lord said: “O great king, if this bodhisatva Siṃhavikrāntagāmin
wishes, then, by the power of the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñānabala),
such rain poured down on world-spheres as numerous as the grains of sand
in the river Gaṅgā, and thus living beings in those world-spheres are satisfied according
to their wishes.In this way, son of good family, when the rain of all kinds of jewels poured
down from the open space, the gods of the earth (bhauma), filled with admiration, said
that this bodhisatva is supposed to become the Gaganagañja.When such rain of all kinds of
jewels poured down, just as the gods of the earth (bhauma) said, so the gods of the Cāturmahārājika
heaven, the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, the Yāṃa heaven, the Tuṣita heaven, and the Nirmāṇarati
heaven, filled with admiration, also said that this bodhisatva is supposed to become
the Gaganagañja. Then the tathāgata Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja rejoiced (anumud-) in that
name, and the buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā rejoiced in
that name.Son of good family, the king Puṇyālaṃkāra, having seen the bodhisatva Siṃhavikrāntagāmin’s
power of supernatural knowledges (abhijñā), merits (puṇya) and knowledges (jñāna),
handed over the crown to his son called Jayamati. Then, with conviction, he left ordinary
household life behind and became a renunciant (śraddhayā āgārād anagārikāṃ pravrajitaḥ),
and thought: “Giving (dāna) is the attachment of thoughts (cittasaṃrakta), but becoming
a renunciant (pravrajyā) is the purification of thoughts;giving is the hinderance of body
and speech (kāyavāc), but becoming a renunciant is the purification of body and speech;giving
is the great hinderance, but becoming a renunciant is eliminating all hinderances;giving
is grass and leaves (tṛṇaparṇa), but becoming a renunciant is obtaining essence and fruit;giving
is constructing what belongs to me (mama), grasping it, and possessing it, but
becoming a renunciant is giving away all you grasp;giving is not moving away from the view
that there is a permanent substance (satkāyadṛṣṭi), but becoming a renunciant is the purification
of all views (sarvadṛṣṭi);giving is a practice like child’s play, but becoming a
renunciant is the state of discipline, calmness, and docileness (ājāneya).’Having this thought,
he who became a renunciant carefully and vigorously practiced in solitude, and soon
he produced the five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā utpāditāḥ).Son of good family, [if
you think that,] at that time, the king Puṇyālaṃkāra was a someone else, you should not
think so (na khalu punar evaṃ draṣṭavyam).Why is that? It is the tathāgata Krakucchanda,
who, during that time, was the universal king Puṇyālaṃkāra (tat kasmād dhetoḥ | krakucchandaḥ
sa tathāgato tena kālena samayena puṇyālaṃkāro nāma rājābhūc cakravartī).The bodhisatva
Gaganagañja was at that time the bodhisatva Siṃhavikrāntagāmin, and thus for the first time
the rain of jewels (ratnavarṣa) poured down from open space.For incalculable and immeasurable
hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of aeons, the rain of jewels has poured down
from the open space since his supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) is imperishable.I was, son
of good family, at that time the bodhisatva Siṃha, and the bodhisatva Maitreya was at that
time the prince Jayamati who succeeded to the crown by the king Puṇyālaṃkāra.Whosoever
is delighted and purified in this words (pravacana), son of good family, that one will be
the basis of living beings who generate the root of good (kuśalamūla).All the living beings
who produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi)
never turn back (avaivartika) from the awakening.When these discourses on amazing history
(itihāsaka) were taught, twelve thousand beings produced the thought of the incomparable
complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).

The Bodhisatva Gaganagañja

Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the supramundane
path (lokottaramārga) of the bodhisatvas, the great beings?”At these words, the Lord
replied to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:Son of good family, what is called the supramundane
path (lokottaramārga) is the six perfections (ṣaṭpāramitā), thirty-seven dharmas which are
the wings of awakening (saptatriṃśadbodhipakṣikadharma), peaceful meditation (śamatha), expanded
vision (vipaśyana), four means of attraction (catvāri saṃgrahavastūni), four meditaions
(catvāri dhyānāni), four immeasurables (catvāry apramāṇāni), four formless states of
meditation (catasra ārūpyasamāpattaya), and five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā). Son
of good family, this is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.The world (loka) is the
five parts of the personality (pañcaskandha).Thus, having known that the form (rūpa) is impermanent
(anitya), suffering (duḥkha), selfless (anātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya),
without distinguishing marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta),
unborn, unproduced, dependently originated, isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya),
without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like an illusion (māyā), like a dream (svapna), like
a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water (udakacandra), like an echo (pratiśrutkā),
like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected image (pratibimba), and like grass,
trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), the bodhisatva
gives a gift, and enters into the suchness of giving (dānatathatā) through the suchness of
form (rūpatathatā).Then he understands the suchness of transforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through
the suchness of giving (dānatathatā), the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā) through
the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā) through the
suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living
being, and the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness of the
self. This the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is
not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son
of good family, because he gives a gift by understanding suchness, this giving is the supramundane
path (lokottaramārga) of bodhisatvas.In the same way, having known that the feeling,
perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent,
the bodhisatva gives a gift.Having known that the consciousness (vijñāna) is suffering
(duḥkha), selfless (anātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing
marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unborn, unproduced,
and dependently originated, he gives a gift.Having known that the consciousness (vijñāna)
is isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like
an illusion (māyā), like a dream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected
in water (udakacandra), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected image (pratibimba),
and has the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), he gives a gift,
and thus understands the suchness of giving through the suchness of consciousness.Then he
understands the suchness of transforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of giving
(dānatathatā), the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā) through the suchness of transforming,
the suchness of living being (satvatathatā) through the suchness of awakening, the
suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living being, and the suchness
of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness of the self. This the suchness of
all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness
(avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, since the
bodhisatva gives a gift by understanding suchness, this giving is the supramudane path (lokottaramārga)
of bodhisatva.Again, son of good family, the bodhisatva, having known that
the form (form) is impermanent (anitya), having protected the morality, etc., and having known
that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa),
preserves the morality (śīlaṃ rakṣ-).Then he understands the suchness of morality
(śīlatathatā) through the suchness of form (rūpatathatā), the suchness of transforming
(pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of morality, the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā)
through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā)
through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness
of living being, and the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness
of the self.The suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness,
is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā).
Since he understands the suchness, son of good family, this protecting the morality is
the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.In the same way, the bodhisatva, having known that
the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are impermanent, having protected the morality, etc., and having known the character of
being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), protects the morality, and then understands
the suchness of morality (śīlatathatā) through the suchness of consciousness (vijñānatathatā).He
understands the suchness of transforming through the suchness of morality, the suchness
of awakening through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being through
the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness of living being,
and the suchness of all dharmas through the suchness of the self. This suchness of all
dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā),
and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Since the bodhisatva understands suchness,
this protecting the morality is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.Again, son
of good family, the bodhistva, having known that the form (rūpa) is impermanent, practices
patience (kṣānti), makes a vigorous effort (vīryam ārabh-) according to what he understands,
concentrates on meditation (dhyāna), and investigates insight (prajñā). Then he, having
known that from the form is impermanent to the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths,
and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), investigates insight.The bodhisatva understands
the suchness of insight through the suchness of form, the suchness of transforming
through the suchness of insight, the suchness of awakening through the suchness of transforming,
the suchness of living beings through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of
the self through the suchness of living beings, the suchness of all dharmas through the suchness
of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness,
is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā).
Son of good family, since he understands the suchness, this preserving the morality
is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.In that way, the bodhisatva, having known that
the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are impermanent, having investigated the insight, etc., and having known the character of
being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), investigates the insight. Then he understands
the suchness of insight (prajñātathatā) through the suchness of consciousness (vijñānatathatā),
the suchness of transforming through the suchness of insight, the suchness of awakening
through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living beings through the suchness
of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness of living beings, the suchness
of all dharmas through the suchness of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā)
is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and
nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, since he understands the suchness,
this investigating the insight is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.Furthermore,
son of good family, the bodhisatva, having known that the form is impermanent, having cultivated
the application of awareness concerned with body (kāye kāyānupaśyanā smṛtyupasthānam),
etc., having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections
(tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), cultivates the application of awareness concerned with
body.The bodhisatva understands the suchness of body (kāyatathatā) through the suchness of
form (rūpatathatā), and understands from the suchness of body to the suchness of all dharmas.
This suchness of all dharmas is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness,
and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he cultivates the application
of awareness concerned with body, and thus, son of good family, this absence of thought-constructions
(nirvikalpa) through the thought-construction connected with body is the
supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.In the same way, having known that the feeling, perception,
formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent,
just as the bodhisatva gives a gift more and more, he expands his feelings, thoughts and
dharmas (vedanācittadharma). Thus he, having known that the form is impermanent, having practiced
the application of awareness which consists in considering the dharma (dharme dharmānupaśyanā
smṛtyupasthānam), etc., having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls,
paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), applies himself to the awareness
which consists in considering the dharma.Thus, he, having known that the feeling, perception,
formative factors and consciousness is impermanent, having practiced the application
of awareness which consists in considering the dharma, etc., having known the character
of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), applies himself to the awareness which consists
in considering the dharma.In that way, what is the suchness of the parts of the personality
(skandhatathatā) is the suchness of the application of awareness (smṛtyupasthānatathatā).
What is the suchness of the application of awareness is the suchness of transforming.
What is the suchness of transforming is the suchness of awakening. What is the suchness
of awakening is the suchness of living beings. What is the suchness of living beings is
the suchness of the self. What is the suchness of the self is the suchness of all dharmas.
What is the suchness of all dharmas is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness,
and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he applies himself to
the awareness concerned with the dharma, he does not make any thought-construction through
the thought-constructions connected with the dharma, and thus such understanding is the
supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.And so on, just as the bodhisatva develops the application
of awareness (smṛtyupasthāna), in the same way, he develops correct elimination (samyakprahāṇa),
the base of magical power (ṛddhipāda), sense organs (indriya), power (bala), the
limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), path (mārga), peaceful meditation (śamatha), expanded vision
(vipaśyana), four means of attraction (catvāri saṃgrahavastūni), four meditaions (catvāri
dhyānāni), four immeasurables (catvāry apramāṇāni), four formless states of meditation
(catasra ārūpyasamāpattaya), five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā).Then, since the
bodhisatva attains the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna) after having known
that the form is impermanent, he, having known that the form is suffering (duḥkha), selfless
(anātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing marks (animitta),
wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unborn, dependently originated, isolated,
cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like an illusion
(māyā), like a dream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water
(udakacandra), like an echo (pratiśrutkā), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected
image (pratibimba), and like grass, trees, walls, paths and reflection (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa),
accomplishes the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna).In
that way, he accomplishes the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna) after having
known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness are impermanent.
Then he, having known the consciousness (vijñāna) is suffering, selfless, tranquil, empty,
without distinguishing marks, wishless, unconditioned, unborn, unproduced, dependently
originated, isolated, cannot be grasped, without basis, unborn, like an illusion, like a
dream, like a mirage, like the moon reflected in water, like an echo, like a reflection,
like a reflected image, and has the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa),
accomplishes supernatural knowledges.To wit, what is the suchness of the parts of the
personality (skandhatathatā) that is the suchness of supernormal knowledges (abhijñātathatā).
What is the suchness of supernormal knowledges that is the suchness of transforming. What
is the suchness of transforming that is the suchness of awakening. What is the suchness
of awakening that is the suchness of living beings. What is the suchness of living beings
that is the suchness of the self. What is the suchness of the self that is the suchness
of all dharmas. What is the suchness of all dharmas that is the absence of suchness, is not
different from suchness, and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he
accomplishes the knowledge of supernormal knowledges (abhijñājñāna), and thus such understanding
is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.Why is that? The supramunane path is
to understand the suchness of form, thus the form is indestructible, uninterrupted, permanent,
dependently originated, and non-origination by its own nature (svabhāvenānutpanna).In
the same way, the bodhisatva understands the suchness of feeling, perception, formative factors
and consciousness, thus consciousness is indestructible, uninterrupted, permanent,
dependently originated, and non-origination by its own nature (svabhāvānutpatti).Transcending
the world of the parts of personality (skandhaloka) is not to be attached to the world
of form or the world without form, but to teach for living beings in the five state of existence
(pañcagatyupapanna) to transcend the world, thus he teaches in that way but does not
destroy the world.Why is that? Because the essential character (lakṣaṇa) that the world
is impermanent is not destroyed. The world is essentially characterized by from suffering,
selflessness, peace, emptiness, non-distinguishing mark, wishlessness, the unconditioned,
to suchness, thus this impermanent world is, son of good family, the pure supramunane path
of the bodhisatvas.The bodhisatva established on the pure path (mārgapariśuddhipratiṣṭhita)
produces the great light of the dharma (mahāntaṃ dharmāvabhāsaṃ karoti) for the sake
of living beings who are on the wrong path.Then those living beings, having attained the light,
are also established in the true supramunane path.This path is the most excellent since
it is for the sake of the obtainment of the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa);this path
is excellent since it is without any bad thought (sarvākuśalacitta);this path is the best
since it is to attain the summit (mūrdhan) for the sake of the knowledge of the buddha (buddhajñāna);this
path is unsurpassed since it releases [living beings] from all the stream
of existence (sarvaughottaraṇa);this path is unexcelled since it transcends all limited paths
(sarvaprādeśikamārga);this path is incomparable since there is no concept of contrary
(pratipakṣānupalambha);this path is unequalled (asamasama) since it is reciting (saṃgīti)
the path of the previous buddhas (pūrvabuddha);this path leads to happiness since it vanquishes
any Māra or adversary (nihatasarvamārapratyarthika);this path leads to no hindrance
since it is the miraculous play (vikrīḍita) by knowing supernormal knowledges (abhijñā) and
the base of magical power (ṛddhipāda);this path is without darkness (tamo’ndhakāra) since
it is completely pure radiance by insight (prajñā);this path is righteous since it is without
deception or guile (māyāśāṭhya);this path is luminous since there is no crooked thinking
(akuṭilacitta);this path is impartial since it has the equal attitude to all living beings
(sarvasatvasamacittatā);this path is vast (vipula) since it is open to all living beings
(sarvasatvāvakāśa);this path is wide since there is no conflict between one another;this
path is in the state of tranquility since it leads to the unbornness (anutpāda);this path
is firm with merits (puṇya) because of the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā);this
path is without affliction (saṃtāpa) because of the perfection of morality (śīlapāramitā);this
path is indestructible because of the perfection of forbearance (kṣāntipāramitā);this
path can not be repulsed (avivārya) because of the perfection of vigour (vīryapāramitā);this
path is free from any impurity (sarvarajavigata) because of the perfection of meditation
(dhyānapāramitā);this path leads to the sameness of open space (gaganasamatā) because
of the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā);this path is in accordance with knowledge (jñānānugamana)
since it is without conceit (nirmānatā);this path is in accordance with cultivating
all qualities of the buddha (sarvadharmaparibhāvana) since all good qualities are
fully accomplished (sarvakuśaladharmasamudānīta).this path is in accordance with one who
turns the wheel of the dharma (dharmacakrapravartanānugamana) since it keeps what has been
taught before (pūrvāvisaṃvādanatā).Since those are the pure supramunane path of the bodhisatvas,
son of good family, having been established in this pure path, the bodhisatva, wearing
the great armour (mahāsaṃnāha), rides in this great vehicle (mahāyāna) and proceeds to
the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa).

This is the armour of bodhisatvas; this is the armour of saving (uttāraṇasaṃnāha) those who
do not yet cross over by the right practice as the great vessel (mahānāvasamyakprayoga);this
is the armour of releasing those who are not yet liberated by being thoroughly liberated
from all fetters of vices and views (sarvakleśadṛṣṭibandhana);this is the armour of consoling
the unconsoled (anāśvāśvasasaṃnāha) by giving up the fear of eradicating all perishable
properties (sarvaparigrahābhaya);this is the armour of liberating those who are not yet
extinguished (aparinirvṛta) by teaching evenness for the inverted in nihilism;this is the
armour of liberating all living beings through the conception that the self, living beings,
life principle, and person do not exist (ātmasatvajīvapudgala);this is the armour of grasping
the true dharma (saddharma) by not considering body or life (kāyajīvatanirapekṣa);this
is the armour of purifying the buddha-field by never being satisfied with the accumulation
of the roots of good (kuśalamūlasaṃbhāra);this is the armour of adorning the body with
the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty (lakṣaṇānuvyañjanakāyālaṃkāra)
by gathering various accumulations of generosity (dānasaṃbhāra);this is the armour of vanquishing
all Māras and adversaries (sarvamārapratyarthika) by attaining supernormal knowledges
(abhijñā);this is the armour of satisfying (saṃtoṣaṇa) all living beings through the
knowledge of special knowledge (pratisaṃvidjñāna);this is the armour of seeking and hearing
all dharmas of the buddha through the knowledge of memory (dhāraṇījñāna);this is the armour
of seeing the thoughts of all living beings (sarvasatvacittadarśanasaṃnāha) through
the knowledge of supernormal knowledges (abhijñājñāna);this is the armour of knowing the superior
or inferior abilities of all living beings (sarvasatvendriyaparāparajñāna) by the
insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna);this is the armour of fulfilling ten powers (daśabalaparipūraṇā)
by the attainment of the power of insight and knowledge (prajñājñānabalasamudāgamana);this
is the armour of attaining fearlessness (abhaya) because their resolutions never
decrease;this is the armour of fulfilling the eighteen special qualities of the Tathāgata
(aṣṭādaśāveṇikabuddhadharmaparipūraka) by fulfilling (paripūraṇa) all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharmaparipūraṇa)
and by abandoning all bad qualities (sarvākuśaladharma);this is
the armour of fearlessness (abhayasaṃnāha) of bodhisatvas because they do not become afraid
(uttras-), frightened (saṃtras-) or fearful, even though they hear that all dharmas are
like an illusion (māyā), a dream (svapna), a reflection (pratibhāsa), an echo (pratiśrutkā),
the moon reflected in water (udakacandra);this is the armour of compassion (mahākaruṇāsaṃnāha)
of bodhisatvas because they never give up any being, even though they know all living
beings are basically in complete extinction (prakṛtiparinirvṛta);this is the armour
of skillful means (upāyakauśalasaṃnāha) of bodhisatvas because they teach life, death, and
birth, even though they hear that all dharmas are empty (śūnyatā), without distinguishing
marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unborn (ajāta),
and unoriginated (anutpanna);this is the undisturbed armour of magical presence (pūrvākopyādhiṣṭhānasaṃnāha)
of bodhisatvas because they never realize (na sākṣātkṛ-) the fruit nor
fall into (na pat-) cessation (nirodha), even though they understand the essential character
entering into the state of being determined (niyāmāvakranti) and know that there is no
origination of any conditioned thing (sarvasaṃskārānutpāda).The bodhisatvas, having clad themselves
in this great armour, enter into the great vehicle (mahāyāna).

The great vehicle (mahāyāna) is made with four wheels (cakra), namely with the means of attraction
(saṃgrahavastu),the spokes (ara) are well fitted as the roots of good (kuśalamūla)
have been transformed (pariṇāmita) with intention (āśaya),it is well made with a deep nave
(gambhīranābhi) as there is the immense knowledge of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādajñāna),it
is well kept together by the axle (akṣa) in order to bear the burdens of all
living beings (sarvasatvabhāra),the pole (īṣā) is firmly fixed since it is supported by the
great friendliness and great compassion (mahāmaitrīmahākaruṇa),it is surrounded with the
railing (vedikā) of all sorts of jewels as it is adorned with all the jewels of dharma (sarvadharmaratnasamalaṃkṛta),it
is fastened with a strong girth (varatra) of the highest intention
(adhyāśaya) since it surpasses one’s earlier promise (pūrvapratijñottaraka),it is
carried on by a yoke (yugaṃdharavāhi) yoked with the team of insight and expedient means
(prajñopāyayuganaddha),it is fastened in the holes of peaceful meditation and expanded vision
(śamathavipaśyanā),it is powered by the power of understanding four holy truths (catuḥsatyaparijñābala),it
has the power of a thousand well-bred horses (ājanya),it goes to all
buddha-fields (sarvabuddhakṣetra) by four magical feet (ṛddhipāda),the horns (śṛṅga) of recollection
are bound with the string of a jewel necklace (ratnamālā),it roams widely and broadly
since it contains all living beings,it fulfills its function (sukṛtakarma) as it subdues
enemies (pratyarthika) and the Māras (mārapratyarthika),it is applied with (prayukta)
practical knowledge and wisdom (vidyājñāna),it is driven by an autopilot (adhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhita),all
buddhas in ten directions think of it,it is well adorned with a lion’s throne (siṃhāsana_samalaṃkṛta),is
praised by all the gods, the king of the gods, and the highest god
(sarvadevaśakrabrahmābhinandita),has good visual form that one never be satisfied with
looking at (atṛptadarśana),is beautiful to behold (darśanīya),is unbreakable because it is
firm as a diamond (vajradṛḍha),is unchangeable due to the promise (pratijñā) based on the
firmness of the highest intention (sārādhyāśaya),is controlled and well-grasped by a charioteer
(sārathi),is always led by the thought of awakening (bodhicittapūrvaṃgama),runs smoothly
as it is attuned to the fulfilling of the qualities of vows (praṇidhānaguṇaparipūrṇānugata),obtains
the light (ālokalabdha) of divine sight in the great view of ten directions
(daśadigvilokitadivyacakṣur),has the pure and wide light of infinite rays (raśmi) so that
it can illuminate the ten directions,is always filled with flowers because the rain of flowers
(puṣpavarṣa), namely the limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), continually pours down,is
equipped with musical instruments which always produce the sound of dharma (dharmasvara),is
in accordance with the mental capacity of followers,strives for all practices of bodhisatva
(sarvabodhisatvacaryāparyeṣṭi),is superior because of infinite knowledge and immeasurable
virtue (anantajñānaākāraguṇa),and is connected with the knowledge of knowing everything
that is emptiness endowed with all sorts of excellencies (sarvākāravaropetaśūnyatāsarvajñajñānasamprayukta).
Son of good family, the great vehicle (mahāyāna) is like that.Therefore,
Good men (satpuruṣa), since the bodhisatva enters on the supramundane way (lokottaramārga)
after having put on the armour, he appears to many beings, performing the deeds of the
Buddha (buddhakārya), even without obtaining omniscience (sarvajñāna).”When this arrangement
of way, armour, and vehicle was displayed, seventy-two thousand gods and human beings
produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening (iha mārgasaṃnāhayānavyūhe nirdiśyamāne
dvisaptatīnāṃ prāṇidevamānuṣaṇām anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni),and
thirty-two thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance that all things are unborn by
purifying the supramundane way (dvātriṃśatīnāṃ ca bodhisatvasahasrāṇām lokottaramārgapariśuddhyā
anutpattikadharmakṣāntiḥ pratilabdhā).

Ratnaśrī

gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 6Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī addressed himself to the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, was the supramunane way purified by you?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, it was purified by purifying myself.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good
family, how did you purify yourself?”Gaganagañja said: “Since this world is pure, son of
good family, I am originally pure.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is the purity
of the world?”Gaganagañja said: “Since the form (rūpa) is originally pure, it is deathless
(acyuta).Since the form in the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the form
in the present is pure, it is established in the true state (dharmatāsthita).In the same
way, since the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are originally pure, those are deathless.Since the consciousness (vijñāna) in
the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the consciousness in the present is pure,
it is established in the true state (dharmatā). Son of good family, this is the purity
of the world.”Ratnaśrī said: “As for the pure world, where can we see it?”Gaganagañja said:
“Son of good family, you can see such pure world in all dharmas.”Ratnaśrī said: “How can
we see all the dharmas?"Gaganagañja said: “It is when we know how to distinguish the past
and future of all dharmas by means of insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna)”Ratnaśrī said:
“How do you distinguish the past and future of all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there
is no cessation (pariccheda) or eternity (śāśvata).”Ratnaśrī said: “Where is no cessation
or eternity?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there is no cessation or eternity there is no origination
or extinction (anutpannāniruddhatā).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this place without origination
or extinction?”Gaganagañja said: “It cannot be verbally expressed.”Ratnaśrī said:
“Why is that?”Gaganagañja said: “Because the dharma is incalculable and ineffable.”Ratnaśrī:
“Son of good family, how can you count the incalculable dharmas (asaṃkhyeyadharma)?”Gaganagañja
said: “Just as, even though on the earth it is possible to measure open space,
in open space it is impossible, just so, even though it is possible to measure by means of
calculation (gaṇanamukhena), it is still impossible to measure by means of calculation. This
is because the nature of the means of calculation is non-calculation.”Ratnaśrī said: “What
then are the means of calculation and the means without calculation?”Gaganagañja said:
“The means of calculation is conditioned (saṃskṛta), and the means without calculation is
unconditioned (asaṃskṛta).Therefore, that which is without calculation in the unconditioned
is beyond calculation, and that which is beyond calculation is unconditioned, thus the
Lord said that by means of insight one should calculate, investigate, and give up what is
to be given up.Accordingly, when the bodhisatva calculates the dharma in the conditioned,
measures it in his consciousness, and reflects on it in the right way, he never sees any
dharma which is to be fully known (parijñeya), to be eliminated (prahātavya), to be realized
(sākṣātkartavya), or to be cultivated (bhāvayitavya).Since the bodhisatva never sees any
dharma, he does not establish any dharma.Where he does not establish any dharma, there is
the attainment of the absence of basis (anālaya).Where he attains the absence of basis,
there is not anything to be wanted.Where there is nothing to be wanted, there is nothing to
be obtained.Since he is free from mental conception (upalambha), there is nothing related
to the self (amama) or nothing to be grasped (aparigraha).What is non-grasping? It is not
grasping permanence or impermanence in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative
factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna);it is not grasping suffering or happiness
in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness; it
is not grasping the self or selflessness in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative
factors or consciousness;it is not grasping the beautiful or the ugly in from, as well
as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or] consciousness; it is not grasping emptiness
or non-emptiness in from, as well as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or]
consciousness.Even though he does not grasp anything, he attains concentration (samādhi).
He stays within existence (saṃsāra), but he never grasps any vice of existence.Even though
he makes living beings believe in extinction, he attained extinction from the beginning
(ādiparinirvṛta).What then is the extinction of the bodhisatva?Extinction (parinirvāṇa) is
the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta).Even though the bodhisatva never makes even a small bad
action (akuśalakarman), he still enters into grasping for the good actions (kuśaladharma).Since
the bodhisatva makes all composite things (sarvasaṃskṛta) as belonging to body, speech,
and mind (kāyavākcitta), he, having investigated them, transforms them into omniscience.He
does not seek omniscience as form nor feeling, nor perception, nor formative factors,
nor consciousness.Because he is not attached to his thoughts and morality, while fulfilling
all his vows (sarvapraṇidhāna), he never sees (na samanupaśyati) the dharma in which
there is increase or decrease.Since the dharma does not decrease nor increase, the bodhisatva,
having attained the sameness of all dharmas (sarvadharmasamatā), performs the practice
of a bodhisatva, being established in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu), thus he neither
performs nor practices any dharma.Son of good family, the bodhisatva who has attained such
extinction performs the practice of the bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā).Why is that? When
the bodhisatva is established in the unconditioned (abhisaṃskāra) among all constructed,
he attains extinction, and therefore the bodhisatva does not construct things among all the
constructed things. Thus the unconditioned is called ‘extinction (parinirvāṇa)’ because
it is not conditioned.Since the other shore (pāra) is that which does not enter into consciousness
(vijñāna), the bodhisatva is characterized (prabhāvita) as having no conceptual activity
(avijñapti), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is without distinguishing
marks (animitta), the bodhisatva does not transform his thoughts into distinguishing
marks, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is beyond false imagination
(parikalpa), his thoughts do not enter into the imagination, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since
the other shore is baseless, he does not transform his thoughts into the absence
of basis (anālaya), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Therefore, son of good family, this is
the extinction of the bodhisatva, namely performing the practice of the bodhisatva.Then
the Lord applauded the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjāya
bodhisatvāya mahāsatvāya sādhukāram adāt): “Well done, good man, well done (sādhu
sādhu satpuruṣa). If it should be explained, I will say like that.”When this teaching was
declared, five hundred bodhisatvas produced the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)].Then
the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja addressed himself
to the Lord: “O Lord, we attained eloquence by this light of the dharma from the tathāgata
(tathāgatadharmāloka).Just as forms appear in dependence on light, so we attained shining
eloquence by the power generated by the tathāgata.”Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī said this
to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, why do you hide your knowledge and teach
that you attained eloquence by the presence of the Buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna)?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, all the eloquence of the bodhisatvas, even a small part of it,
should be seen as the presence of the Buddha. Why is that? If the buddhas do not make those
dharmas appear, how could the bodhisatva attain eloquence?”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good
family, how is the eloquence transferred?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, there is
no transference [of eloquence,] but, nevertheless, the eloquence is attained by the eloquence
of the Buddha.”Just as, even though ignorance (avidyā) is not transferred to the formative
factors (saṃskāra), the formative factors are produced by the cause of ignorance, just
so, even though the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere, by its cause
the eloquence still arises.Just as the sounds of horses, elephants, and human beings (hayagajamanuṣyakāḥ
śabdāḥ) are not transferred to an echo (pratiśrutkā) but because of it the
echo (pratiśrutkā) arises, just so the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere
but by its cause the eloquence still arises.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, dependent
origination (pratītyasamutpāda) is profound (gambhīra).”Gaganagañja said: “In the same way
any dharma is never born.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is it that there is
no dependent origination of any dharma?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, if a certain
agent (kartṛ) is in conditions, the dharmas will be born, but, because any agent is not
apprehended in conditions, the agent is not apprehended in any dharma.Ratnaśrī said: “Son
of good family, what is it that the Tathāgata never appears?”Gaganagañja said: “if suchness
arises, the tathāgata will appear, but still we hold the view that suchness never arises.
Why is that? Suchness is brought about (prabhāvita) through non-arising. One who understands
all dharmas just like the suchness, he is called the tathāgata.Ratnaśrī said: “Son of
good family, why did the tathāgata come?”Gaganagañja said: “Something like that should be
let alone (sthāpanīya).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this letting alone?”Gaganagañja said: “Because
the absolute truth (dharmadhātu) is in accordance with its proper place (yathāsthāna).”Ratnaśrī
said: “What is the place of the absolute truth?”Gaganagañja said: “It is not the
place of birth nor the place of death, it is neither a place nor non-place. Such a place
is the place of the absolute truth, and just the place of absolute truth is the place of
all dharmas.The place of all dharmas is not a place, and that which is not a place is without
place because there is no place of birth or place of death, thus it is neither a place
nor non-place. Such is the place of the tathāgata which is not considered as the place of
birth nor the place of cessation.In this way, son of good family, that the tathāgata appears
is an extreme (eko ’ntaḥ) and that the tathāgata never appears is another extreme, thus
you should seek the tathāgata from the middle way (madhyamapratipad) which is free from
both extremes, namely the existence of birth or the non-existence of birth.”Ratnaśrī said:
“Son of good family, although that the buddha arises from the absence of the place of birth
or death is profound, son of good family, who would believe this appearing of the buddha?”Gaganagañja
said: “One who does not make any matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa).”Ratnaśrī
said: “Son of good family, how is ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ explained?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ is a word for imputing (samāropa).One
who does not impute anything to any dharma does not makes any matter of dispute concerning
any dharma, therefore a word for ‘no matter of dispute’ is a word for sameness (samatā);a
word for sameness is a word for the incomparable (asadṛśa);a word for the incomparable
is a word for the absence of words (apada);a word for the absence of words is a word
for the absence of letters (anakṣara);a word for the absence of letters is a word for the
absence of information (avijñapti);a word for the absence of information, in which there
is no activity (apracāra) of thoughts and mind (cittamanas), is a word for the absence of
activity;Just as, even though bird-tracks do not remain in the sky, we still talk about it
with the place of sound, in the same way, whether the buddha is born or unborn, we still
talk about it with the word to be born.In that case, even though the bodhisatva teaches non-origination
(anutpāda), he still makes things appear.Why is that? Because the essential
nature of all dharmas (sarvadharmasvabhāva) is the essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasavabhāva);the
essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasvabhāva) is without own nature (niḥsvabhāva);that
which has no essential nature, in that there is no existence;that in which
there is no existence, that is established nowhere, thus all dharmas are the limit established
nowhere (apratiṣṭhitakoṭi);the limit established nowhere is the limit of all dharmas,
thus all the dharmas are called ‘being established in the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi)’;what
is called the limit of reality is the unlimited limit (aparicchinnakoṭi);since the limit
is in accordance with all limits, all dharmas appear as having attained the limit.Why
is that? Because, even if the limit attains another part of the sky, it is still the same
limit in the sky. Just as there is no border dividing the sky, just so there is no limit
of any dharma (sarvadharmakoṭi) in the limit of reality (bhutakoṭi).Since the limit of reality
is the limit of the self (ātmakoṭi), by knowing the limit of the self, the knowledge
of the limit of all beings is understood.Since the limit of all dharmas is unified with the
limit of all beings, all dharmas are called ‘the limit of exhaustion (kṣaya), the end of
exhaustion, and the ultimate of exhaustion.’What is called ‘exhaustion (kṣaya)’ is a designation
(adhivacana) for extinction (nirvāṇa), and thus all dharmas are the same as extinction.Why
is that? Because it is without adversary (niṣpratipakṣa).Just as there is no adversary
in open space, so there is no adversary in all dharmas.Those who seek extinction (nirvāṇa)
in the perspective of an adversary see birth and death, and those who think that these
dharmas will be born and will die never know the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā)
since they practice in birth and death.Therefore, the Lord said “You should know! you should
know! Do not dispute! Do not dispute! Fulfill the indisputable excellent qualities of
ascetics (śrāmaṇa)!”

Ānanda

At that time, the venerable Ānanda addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu āyuṣman ānando
bhagavantam etad avocat):“It is a marvelous thing, Lord, just as the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
manifests his body, just so he teaches us.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda,
my body is manifested though, it is not manifested by myself.Why is that? Because open
space is my body, it is manifested.”Ānanda said: “How then is your body manifested?”Gaganagañja
said: “This is because, even though the buddha’s work (buddhakṛtya) is done by the
body, the true body (dharmakāya), which is not undefiled, is not brought about through
the parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana), nor born
of the inverted body (viparyayakāya), but obtained by the mental body (manaskāya). In this
way, the bodhisatva’s body is manifested.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, are you manifesting
all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda, one should not think of my body separated
from the dharma, it is the dharma itself, and the dharma itself is my body, in this
way I manifest my body.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, if you manifested your body,
are you an Arhat?”Gaganagañja said: “Having penetrated the entrance into the dharma which
is free from impurity (araṇādharmamukhaprativedha), without desire (rāga), I do not have any
aversion or bewilderment (dveṣamoha), thus I am an Arhat.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family,
if you are a Worthy One, when did you reach complete extinction (parinirvāṇa)?”Gaganagañja
said: “Venerable Ānanda, an Arhat does not reach extinction, and ordinary people (pṛthagjanā)
are not Arhats who reach extinction.Why is that? Because an Arhat gives up the concept
of extinction (nirvāṇasaṃjñā).Since ordinary people just produce the thought-constructions
of extinction, to the extent that they made thought-constructions do they reach extinction.”Ānanda
said: “According to our interpretation of what you said, son of good family,
you are not an Arhat, ordinary man (pṛthagjana), one who is undergoing training (śaikṣa),
one who no longer needs training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tathāgata.”Gaganagañja
said: “Good, Ānanda, very good. Even though the bodhisatva, who is not an Arhat,
ordinary man (pṛthagjana), one who is undergoing training (śaikṣa), one who no longer needs
training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tathāgata, teaches every stage (sarvabhūmi),
he is still not established in any place.”When this teaching was declared, in order
to protect the dharma, five hundred disciples, immediately offering dharma-robes to the
bodhisatva Gaganagañja, said: “May all living beings attain eloquence such as this (sarvasatvā
īdṛśasya pratibhānasya lābhino bhavantu)!”Then, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja, the dharma-robes disappeared into open space.Then those monks, the Worthy
Ones, said: “Son of good family, where did the dharma-robes go?”Gaganagañja said: “They
went into the treasury of open space.”Then the Lord smiled (atha khalu bhagavān smitaṃ
prādurakarot), and the venerable Ānanda asked the meaning of smiling: “O Lord, as the tathāgata
does not smile for no reason, what is the reason for smiling?”The Lord said: “Ānanda,
the bodhisatva Gaganagañja received five hundred robes by those five hundred monks, put
them into the treasury of open space, sprinkled on the world-sphere called Kāṣāyadhvaja. In
this way he performed the buddha-activities (buddhakārya) in the buddha-field of the tathāgata
Parvatarāja. Then the religious discourses given by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja arose
from those dharma-robes in the buddha-field, and hundreds koṭis of bodhisatvas attained
the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)] by the teaching of the
dharma.Ānanda, you should see the sphere of supernatural power and knowledge (ṛddhijñānaviṣaya)
of the bodhisatva in order to bring various living beings to maturity (anekaparyāyasatvaparipācana).When
this teaching was taught, the great rain of flowers, which have been
never seen before, shining brilliantly like the radiant sun and moon (candrasūrya), poured
down, and a voice resonated from those flowers: “Having heard this teaching of the bodhisatva
Gaganagñja, those living beings with faith, being sealed with the irreversible seal
(avaivartikamudrā), will be devoted themselves to the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa).”Ānanda
said: “O Lord, where are these flowers coming from?”The Lord said: “Ānanda, the Brahmā
Prabhāvyūha, who reigned over one hundred thousand world-spheres, sprinkled these flowers
in order to worship (pūjākarmaṇa) the bodhisatva Gaganagañja.”Ānanda said: “O Lord, we would
like to see him.”The Lord said: “Just wait a minute, Ānanda, you will see him soon.”

Prabhāvyūha

At that time, the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha, being surrounded and followed (parivṛta) by sixty-eight
hundred thousand Brahmās, teleported from the world of Brahmā to the presence of the Lord
(brahmaloke antarhitaḥ bhagavato ’ntike prātiṣṭhata), bowed down at his feet (bhagavataḥ
pādau śirobhir vanditvā), circumambulated him three times (tripradakṣiṇīkṛṭya), and sat down
on a side.Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, the greatness
(māhātmya) of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s morality, concentration, supernormal knowledge,
knowledge, insight, fulfilling vows, skillful means, highest intention, mastery of
the dharma, ornaments for body, speech and thought, and mastery over all dharmas (śīlasamādhyabhijñājñānaprajñāpraṇidhānaparipūraṇopāyakauśalādhyāśayadharmeśvarakāyavākcittālaṃkārasarvadharmavaśitā)
are marvelous (āścarya)!Since the bodhisatva Gaganagañja has purified his
former activities, he manifests all activities by body, speech, and thought without any
effort. O Lord, since his former roots of good (pūrvakuśalamūla) have been not yet repaid
by anyone, that the bodhisatva Gaganagañja roars this lion’s roar (siṃhanādanādi) in the
present time is the outcome of the profound practice in the past.”The Lord said: “Quite so,
it is just as you have said. The incomparable complete awakening of the bodhisatvas arises
from the former roots of good, merits, and knowledges (pūrvakuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then
the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the root of good of the bodhisatvas,
what is the merit, what is the knowledge?”The Lord said: “Brahmā, ‘the root of
good (kuśalamūla)’ is the initial resolution to strive for awakening (prathamacittotpādika),
and the root of all qualities of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmamūla);‘merit (puṇya)’ is,
as soon as the thought of awakening is produced, to conquer all items of meritorious action
consisting in generosity, morality, and meditational self-cultivation of all disciples

this way, Brahmā, the bodhisatva arises from the root of good,
merit, and knowledge (kuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the
Lord: “It is a marvelous, Lord, that the tathāgata explains all sorts of qualities of the
buddha (sarvabuddhadharmanānātva) by means of these three root words [or stages] (mūlapada).”At
these words, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said to the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha: “Brahmā,
everything is included in a single word (ekapadasamavasṛta).Why is that? The word ‘emptiness
(śūnyatā)’ is a single word, and everything is included in emptiness;the word ‘signlessness
(ānimitta)’ is a single word, and everything is included in signlessness;the word ‘wishlessness
(apraṇihita)’ is a single word, and everything is included in wishlessness;in the
same manner, the words ‘the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskāra), non-desire (virāga), peace
(śānti), non-basis (anālaya), the absolute truth (dharmadhātu), suchness (tathatā), the limit
of reality (bhūtakoṭi), inexistence (asaṃbhava), and unbornness (anutpāda), each of them
is a single word, [and everything is included in them];the word ‘extinction (nirvāṇa)’
is a single word, and everything is included in extinction.Further, Brahmā, desire (rāga)
is a word for non-desire. Why? Because desire is the essence of non-desire (virāgasvabhāva).
Thus everything is included in the essence of desire (rāgasvabhāva).Aversion (dveṣa) is
a word for non-aversion (adveṣa). Why? Because aversion is the essence of non- aversion (aveṣasvabhāva).
Thus everything is the essence of aversion.Bewilderment (moha) is a word for
non-bewilderment (amoha). Why? Because bewilderment is the essence of non-bewilderment
(amohasvabhāva). Thus everything is the essence of bewilderment.Aggregation of perishable
things (satkāya) is a word for no aggregation of perishable things. Why? Because aggregation
of perishable things is the essence of no aggregation of perishable things. Thus everything
is the essence of aggregation of perishable things.Form (rūpa) is a word for the absence
of form. Why? Because form is the essence of absence of form. Thus everything is the essence
of form.In the same way, feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are words for the absence of feeling, perception, formative factors
or consciousness. Why? Because feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness
are the essence of absence of them. Thus everything is the essence of feeling, perception,
formative factors and consciousness.It is the same for fields, sense perceptions (dhātvāyatana),
and the twelve links of dependent origination (dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).Ignorance
(avidyā) is a word for the absence of ignorance. Why? Because ignorance is the essence
of the absence of ignorance, all dharmas of the buddha are the essence of ignorance.Birth
is a word for no birth (anutpāda). Why? Because birth is the essence of no birth, all
dharmas of the buddha are the essence of birth.All teachings of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharma)
is a word for no teaching (adharma). Why? Because everything is the essence of no
thought-construction (avikalpa), all teachings of the buddha are the essence of all teachings.Brahmā,
those are the door of entering into a word for dharma called (dharmapada) ‘the
entrance into the word without word (apadapadapraveśa)’ in which all dharmas of the buddha
are included in one single word.Just as, Brahmā, all streams flow into the great ocean (mahāsāgara),
just so all qualities of the buddha are included in a single word ‘the entrance
into the dharma (dharmamukha).’Just as, Brahmā, all manifestations of forms (sarvarūpāvabhāsa)
appear in open space, just so all teachings of the buddha are included in a single
word, thus this word is the inexhaustible word and the word which is split into one hundred
thousand.Just as, Brahmā, even though all of one hundred thousand are included in a single
word which is split into one hundred thousand, and even though those have been removed
after having been split for a thousand years, the muchness of one hundred thousand is neither
established in the connection with that word nor connected to ‘one hundred thousand,’
just so, Brahmā, while calculating and measuring to split the qualities of the buddha for
many hundreds of thousands of aeons, the qualities of the buddha are never experienced by
body or thought, thus those are impossible to be explained and too much to be explained.Further,
muchness is non-muchness. Why is that? If someone obtained so much or not so much,
it would be just as much as he obtained because there is no muchness or non-muchness. Thus
it is impossible to say that it is much or not much.Brahmā, calculating the dharmas of the
buddha is calculating all dharmas. Why is that? Because all dharmas are the dharmas of
the buddha, and the dharmas of the buddha are neither the dharmas nor non-dharmas.Why is that?
The dharmas of the buddha cannot be mentally constructed (parikalpita) by perception
(saṃjñā), or rather, those are taught in order to fully know the perception. Thus the thought-construction
(parikalpa) that there is neither perception nor non-perception is neither
the dharma nor the non-dharma.Brahmā, since the dharmas of the buddha have such an essential
character (lakṣaṇa), by their own essential character, they are pure and transcendent
(svalakṣaṇapariśuddhasvalakṣaṇavivikta).Since own essential character (svalakṣaṇa) is the
absence of essential character (alakṣaṇa), the open space has no essential character and
it is characterized as all dharmas.When this religious discourse was given by the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja, twelve thousand Brahmās in the assembly produced the thought of the incomparable
complete awakening, and five thousand Brahmās, who had planted the well prepared roots
of good (parikarmāvaropitakuśalamūla), attained the tolerance that all things are unborn
(anutpattikadharmakṣānti).

in those one hundred twenty-eight dharmas.Son of good family, this is the brief explanation
of all dharmas (sarvadharmasamāsanirdeśa). If I were to explain the dharmas in more
than one word or more than two words, the true state of the dharmas (dharmāṇāṃ dharmatā)
would never be exhausted to an aeon or more than an aeon (kalpaṃ vā kalpāvaśeṣaṃ vā), but
my eloquence (pratibhāna) also will not be exhausted.When this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya),
a chapter of the collection of dharma (dharmasaṃgraha), was taught, the bodhisatva
Ratnapāṇi covered this world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu)
with his precious right hand (ratnadakṣiṇapāṇi) in order to pay respect (pūjākarmaṇa)
to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja and his exposition of religion.In that very moment,
from his precious right hand, flowers (puṣpa), incense (gandha), garlands (mālā), unguents
(upalepana), aromatic powers (cūrṇa), robes (cīvara), parasols (chattra), banners (dhvaja),
pennons (patākā), and whatever sound of musical instruments poured down on the worlds
of the ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu).All the world system of three thousandfold worlds
was covered with the rain of flowers up to the height of the knees (jānumātra);all the
vault of the sky was adorned with parasols, banners, pennons, and robes (chattradhvajapatākācīvara);and
the following verses issued from the sound of musical instruments:

185 This good man, who is filled with one hundred kinds of good qualities, keeping and spreading
his qualities, overcomes evil beings and attains recollection, intelligence and understanding
(smṛtimatigati). When the voice of the best ascetic (śramaṇavara) resonates, cyclic
existences in the ten directions are purified.186 He, who is filled with sublime confidence
(adhimukti), who is free from impurities (rajas) and darkness (tamas), purifying a hundred
[previous] existences, leading gods and humans (devamānuṣa) to the sphere without destruction,
being endowed with ten powers and the sky-like mind, becomes free from existence.187
As he purifies his speech gracefully and gloriously, he has no harshness, erroneousness,
or impurity. Since he is incomparable in the three states of existence (tribhava), he
is respected by gods and humans. Being free from existence, he brings happiness and benefits
to living beings.188 He, who trains himself with confidence, recollection, intelligence
and understanding (adhimuktismṛtimatigati), conquers the power of others (parabala) by means
of ten powers (daśabala) and superior powers, defeats enemy troops, and attains the state
of immortality. O good man, beyond existence, the voice of the wise resonates.189 Even
though he does not go anywhere separated from this assembly, he educates gods and humans
without moving in ten directions. He does not stay any particular place, but he stays with
his intelligence and is unwavering in the realm of the dharma (dharmadhātu), just as earth
is unshakable.190 As the sunshine removes darkness and impurities, so does this good man.
He, who is united with the light of insight, spreads glorious light, thereby all the realm
of Māra, having been filled with the light of the Sage (muni), is outshone (dhyāmīkṛta).191
Just as the wind in open space enters everywhere without any base (sthāna) and has no
thought-constructions (avikalpa) or false imagination (parikalpa), just so the sons of the
buddha (jinaputra) whose minds are like open space are in accordance with all living beings
and thus they are respected by gods and humans.192 The water in the ocean (sāgarajala)
of three thousandfold worlds is measurable, a bird-track in the sky (gaganaśakunipada) in
ten directions is expressible, and someone can have the same thought as all living beings;
but the great qualities (mahāguṇa) of the son of the Sage (muni) are inexhaustible.

Māra Pāpīyān

When this teaching was taught and verses were accomplished, the wicked Māra, having magically
created four kinds of troops (caturaṅgabala), came to the courtyard where the Lord stayed
with them, stationed them on the outside of the courtyard, disguised himself as a householder
(gṛhapati), went in front of the Lord, and bowed down at his feet (bhagavataḥ pādau
śirobhir vanditvā), saying:“Because these good men, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja and Ratnapāṇi,
are endowed with immeasurable good qualities, and so are the other bodhisatvas, it is
possible to manifest such wonderful teachings (āścaryādbhutadharma) and magical displays (prātihārya)
in this world. However, Lord, will there be someone believing these magical displays
in the future?”The Lord said: “As a small amount of water in the great ocean can be
lifted up by means of the tip of a hair (vālāgrakoṭi), so few beings will have faith in the
magical displays (prātihārya) of these good men. However, there will be great many beings
who do not have faith, compared to the quantity of water in the ocean.”Having heard this
word, the wicked Māra, became contented, elated, enraptured, overjoyed, exultant and jubilant
(atha khalu māraḥ pāpīyāṃs tuṣṭodagrāttamanāḥ pramuditaḥ prītisaumanasyajāto bhavati),
danced and was about to leave the congregation.The the venerable Śāriputra addressed himself
to the Lord: “O Lord, who is this man (puruṣa) going away from this congregation with
so much pleasure?”The Lord said: “O Śāriputra, he is the Māra, who, disguised as a householder,
came to the tathāgata in order to make this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya)
disappear. Having heard that there will be only few beings who have belief in this religious
exposition, he is about to leave this congregation, joyfully singing, ‘There will be only
few followers of the ascetic Gautama, but mine will be numerous.’”At that time the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja said to the wicked Māra: “Wicked One, why are you leaving after having
shown your true colors?”Then the wicked Māra thought: “Because the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
and other bodhisatvas will come to my territory (māragocara), to say nothing of the tathāgata
(prāg eva tathāgataḥ). So now I will go back to my territory.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja,
having stopped the wicked Māra and his servants in the vault of the sky, exercised
his magical power in such a way (tathādhiṣṭhita) that they could not go back to his territory,
and said this to the Māra: “Wicked One, as open space is without obstruction (anavṛti),
why do you not go back to your territory?”Māra said: “Son of good family, the sky is
without obstruction (gaganam anāvṛtam) to you, but it looks dark to us. The only we can see
in front of us is darkness (tamo’ndhakāra), except for the congregation (parṣanmaṇḍala)
of the Buddha on the ground, which looks luminous.”Gaganagañja said: “So it is, Wicked One,
it is beings who have the light of the dharma in their thoughts (śukladharmacittasatva),
and the darkness in front of you is because of the works of Māra (mārakarman).”Māra said:
“O good man, from now on I will never do the works of Māra.”Gaganagañja said: “As it is
difficult to keep your promise among such wicked beings, you should come down here and listen
the discipline of the dharma (dharmavinaya) taught by the tathāgata, together with your
servants.”Then the wicked Māra and his servants unwillingly (akāmaka) went down from the
vault of the sky, and the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to the congregation of bodhisatvas:
“Sons of good family, may all of you elucidate (pratibhātu) the gates into the dharma
of transcending the path of the works of Māra (mārakarmamārgasamatikramadharmamukha).”The
bodhisatva Kāñcanaparvatarāja thereupon said: “Giving up your sphere is to be attached to
the sphere of Māra (māraviṣaya). Knowing that everywhere is the sphere of the buddha (buddhaviṣaya)
is to know the sphere of the buddha. If you do not see the sphere of the buddha,
how can you see your own sphere? In that way the bodhisatva who has transcended the sphere
has also transcended the sphere of Māra. This is the gate into the dharma of transcending
the sphere of Māra.”The bodhisatva Ratnaśrī said: “Since the objects of thought is the
sphere of Māra (māragocara), where there is not any dharma perceived, what would be accomplished
by Māra there? Since the attainment is without basis, the understanding through time
that there is no attainment with basis is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending
the sphere of Māra of the bodhisatva.’”The bodhisatva Ratnapāṇi said: “When you grasp or
possess something, then the Māra will find your weak point (avatāraṃ labh-). When you do not
grasp any dharma, there will be no disagreement with anyone. When you are alone without
the second, you do not make your own thinking or own place [into problem], and then how can
you stay together with the Māra? Thus the bodhisatva who is established in nothing transcends
the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Āryaratna said: “‘Sin’ (āpatti) is an accusation,
and in such an accusation the Māra can find a weak point. What is the absence of sin
(anpatti) is not to enter into the consciousness of following in accordance with the distinguishing
marks [of sins] (nimittānusāriṇavijñānāpraveśa), and thus the bodhisatva who is
established in the limit of no distinguishing mark transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The
bodhisatva Ratnacitta said: “The Lord taught that vices (kleśa) are just like a reflection
(pratibimba) and an illusion (pratibhāsa). Knowing that the reflection and illusion are
not changing nor not changing, not coming nor going, without inside nor outside, and remain
in no location or dimension (sthānāsthānavigatā) is not living with any vice. The vices
do not arise due to the absence of thought-construction; the vices do not cease due to the
absence of thought-construction. In this way, the bodhisatva who is established in the absence
of thought-construction and false imagination transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The
bodhisatva Ratnākara said: “Happiness is a latent tendency (anuśaya); unhappiness is an obstruction.
One who is without happiness or unhappiness does not have any affection (anunaya)
or hostility (pratigha). One who is without affection or hostility is established in sameness.
One who is established in sameness does not differentiate any dharma. One who is
established in the absence of differentiation does not think about sameness or non-sameness.
When you obtain this inconceivable dharma, the Māra cannot find your weak point.”The bodhisatva
Ratnaparityāga said: “The works of Māras (mārakarman) is produced from obsession
with self (ātmasamutthāna). When you are established in the purity of self, what can the Māra
do? Why is that? Because vices are purified by the purity of self (ātmaviśuddhi), and
all dharmas are purified by the purity of vices. That which purifies all dharmas purifies
open space. Thus the bodhisatva who is established in the purity of open space transcends
the sphere of the Māra.The bodhisatva Dharmarāja said: “Just as one, who obtains the consecration
of the king (rājābhiṣeka), and who has power and numerous attendants, is fearless,
just so the bodhisatva, who obtains the consecration, and who has the attendants of the jewel
of the dharma (dharmaratna), has no fear of any Māra. Here the consecration is to reach
the extreme of the qualities of the buddha (paryantabuddhadharma) and to fulfill them,
and the attendants of the jewel of the dharma (dharmaratna) is to learn the dharmas taught
by the buddhas in ten directions. Since the bodhisatva who is established in such a way transcends
the sphere of the Māra, this is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending the
sphere of the Māra.’”The bodhisatva Śailaśikharasaṃghaṭṭanarāja said: “Just as the wind
enters through a chink, just so the Māra can find a weak point where there is a chink in thought.
The bodhisatva therefore should not have any chink in his thought. Here, the thought
without chink is, that is to say, to fulfill the emptiness endowed with all sorts of excellencies
(tadyathāpi nāma cchidrān mārutaḥ praviśati evam eva yato yata eva cittasya cchidraṃ

This is the gate to the light of the dharma (dharmālokamukha) that the bodhisatva transcends
the sphere of the Māra.”Quotation from ŚikṣMS 60b5-7; B 117,7-10; ŚikṣTib(D) 67b1-3;

bodhisatva Priyadarśana said: “That among
all kinds of seeing, seeing the buddha and his dharma is the most excellent. Here, seeing
the buddha is not to see form, feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness. The
correct seeing (samyagdṛṣṭi) is to see the buddha. Seeing the dharma is not to make any
mental effort (manasikāra). The unchanging seeing is to be free from attachment (rāga). Being
free from attachment is to see the dharma. That the bodhisatva comes to be endowed with
seeing the buddha and his dharma in that way is transcending the sphere of the Māra. This
is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending the sphere of the Māra.’”The bodhisatva
Indrajālin said: “Since the deeds of the Māra arises from action [of speech], mental activity
and movements [of body] (iñjitamanyanāsyandita), the bodhisatva should be free from the
basis of action [of speech], mental activity and movements [of body], which are superficial
mental activities (ayoniśomanasikāra). With the thorough practice (yoniśaḥprayoga), the
bodhisatva who is free from action [of speech], mental activity and movements [of body]
transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Guṇarājaprabhāsa said: “As many as there
are antidotes (pratipakṣa), so many are the works of the Māra (mārakarman). The absence
of antidote is [included in] the realm of the dharma (dharmadhātu), and all dharmas are [included
in] the realm of the dharma. Since all dharmas are included in the realm of the dharma
(dharmadhātusamavasaraṇa), all the dharmas are understood through understanding the realm
of the dharma. The works of the Māra is not apprehended apart from the realm of the dharma,
and the realm of the dharma which is the same as the works of the Māra is not different
from suchness (tathatā). In this way, the bodhisatva who enters into one single principle
(ekanaya) transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Gandhahastin said: “The weak
(durbala) can be harmed by the Māra; but the strong (balika) cannot be harmed by the Māra.
The weak is afraid of the three gates of liberation (trivimokṣamukha). Since the strong
is not afraid of the three gates of liberation, namely, directly seeing (pratyakṣa), penetrating
(supratividdha), and meditatively cultivating. One who is not afraid of them transcends
the sphere of the Māra, and thus this is the gate into the light of the dharma (dharmālokamukha)
called ‘Transcending the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Maitreya said:
“Just as the water in the great ocean (mahāsāgara) has a single taste (ekarasa), so all dharmas
in the great ocean of the knowledge of the dharma (dharmajñānasāgara) have a single
taste. Since the works of the Māra (mārakarma) and the works of the buddha (buddhakarma),
both are same in the perspective of emptiness (śūnyatā), signlessness (animitta), wishlessness
(apraṇihita), birthlessness (ajāti), and the absence of origination (anutpāda), the bodhisatva
who enters into the single taste (ekarasa) transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The
bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “O friends (vata mārṣāḥ), since open space transcends all spheres,
it is not the sphere of sight (cakṣurviṣaya), and likewise it is not the sphere of
hearing, smelling, tasting, body and mind (śrotraghrāṇajihvākāyamanaḥ). Since all dharmas
are the sphere of the essential nature of open space (gaganasvabhāva), body and speech (kāyavāc)
are the light of knowledge (jñānāloka) in accordance with the sameness of open space
(gaganasamatā). Thus the bodhisatva who obtains this light of knowledge transcends the
sphere of the Māra, and this is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending the sphere of
the Māra.’”The bodhisatva Mañjuśrī said: “O good man, all you have said is the works of
the Māra and the sphere of the Māra. Why is that? Things expressed by words are a mere information
(vijñapti); but the speech of the buddha (buddhaghoṣa) is beyond verbal expressions
(anakṣara). Since, as many as are words, so many are the works of the Māra, when there
is not any word, nothing would be done by the Māra. Since that which is without word is without
information, one never perceives the self or other (na ātmaparaṃ samanupaśyati). Since
there is no self or others, the dharma which causes benefit or harm does not exist. Understanding
like this is transcending the sphere of the Māra, and, son of good family, this
is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending the sphere of the Māra of the bodhisatva.’”Then
the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to the wicked Māra: “Wicked One, did you hear
this gate into the dharma of transcending the sphere of the Māra?”Māra said: “Yes, I heard.”Gaganagañja
said: “Wicked One, are you still going to do the works of the Māra among the
bodhisatvas who entered into such guiding principle of the dharma (dharmanaya)?”Māra said:
“Son of good family, by hearing this gate into the dharma of transcending the sphere of
the Māra, I would not dare to do the works of the Māra among those who listen to it, to say
nothing of the bodhisatvas who see it directly (pratyakṣa) by their knowledges.”At that
time, four gods, Saṃcayavigata, Sukhasaṃcaya, Gandhavat, and Prāsādavat, who guarded the
bodhisatvas, said to the Wicked Māra:“In the past, at the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa),
the Lord met you, your forces, troops, army and servants directly. At that time, the Lord
touched the ground with the jewels in his hand (ratnapāṇi), which are the accumulation of
friendliness, compassion, generosity, discipline, restrain, gentleness, morality, learning,
concentration, insight, firm and burning effort, merit and knowledge (maitrīkaruṇadānavinayasaṃyamasauratyaśīlaśrutasamādhiprajñādṛḍhottaptavīryapuṇyajñānasaṃbhāra),
and then the
endless, limitless worlds (anantāparyanteṣu lokadhātuṣu) were shaken. In that way it was
manifested that you and your forces were defeated, but will you still do the works of Māra
under the Lord and the bodhisatvas? You should pay homage to the tathāgata and the assembly
of the bodhisatvas!”Then the Wicked One, having conjured up canopies adorned with eighty
four thousand jewels (ratnacchattra), offered them to the congregations. Having held numerous
kinds of divine flowers (divyapuṣpa), incense (gandha), garlands (mālā) and unguents
(upalepana), he scattered them on the place where the Lord stayed, and said this to the
Lord together with his servants: “If the bodhisatva Gaganagañja gives us the treasury of open
space (gaganagañja), we will produce the thought of the incomparable complete awakening
(anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Wicked One, do you see this
treasury of open space?”Māra said: “I see it, son of good family. It is far greater than all
the displays of desire realm, buddha-fields, and my own abode (svabhavana), and it is full
of the jewels for gods and humans.Gaganagañja said: “Wicked One, I will give you all these
treasuries of open space so that you can produce the thought of the incomparable complete
awakening.”Then the wicked Māra, together with his eighty-four thousand creatures, produced
the thought of the incomparable complete awakening.At that time, Durmukha who was the
head of five hundred sons of the Māra, lacking faith and desiring the non-dharma (adharmakāma),
said: “Even though our father produced the thought of awakening, we should strive
against this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya).”Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, elucidate the words of knowledge-mantra (vidyāmantrapada)
by which the evil ones as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅga are subjugated
(nigraha) and established in awakening.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja thereupon pronounced
the words of knowledge-mantra as follows:tadyathā | avatte | vivatte | saṃvatte | sahitānusandhi
| duruttaraṇi | nirghātani | maitryāyukte | kāruṇaniṣyande | satyavati | bhūrakṣe
| dharmanivṛtti | dharmarakṣe | akkhule | nikhilini | hulu hulu hulu hulu hulu | tatkāre
| tathāvādite | śīlānuvṛtti | akṣayanirdeśe | kleśaparīkṣe | buddhādhiṣṭhite dharmajvālini
| saṃghānugame | anuttare | anatikramaṇiye | nigrahaṇimārapakṣasya yuktikṛte | adānte
| aśaste | svaviṣayānugame | āryaguṇakāre | siddhisiddhivate | mokṣānukūle | nigrahaṇi parapravadīnāṃ
| dārṣaṇi māraparṣada | avaśāntā | catvāro mahārājānaḥ | śakro devānāṃ indro
brahmā sahapatir | buddhaprasannānāṃ | devanāgayakṣakṛtaṃ paritrāṇaṃ | satvānāṃ svastyayānāṃ
| dharmabhanakānāṃ | ārakṣayai | saddharmasya ca parigrahāya |Then, immediately after
these words of knowledge-mantra were pronounced by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the world system
of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu) was shaken in six ways.The
five hundred evil ones, who were without faith and clinging to the non-dharma, heard
this sound from open space: “The Māra, his sons, or his followers (mārakāyika), who do not
produce the thought of awakening and do not give up the works of the Māra after having heard
these words of the knowledge-mantra (vidyāmantrapada), the crowns of their heads will
be destroyed by the lighting and blazing thunderbolt of the Yakṣa Vajrapāṇi.”Then, having
looked up at the sky, the sons of the Māra saw five hundred Vajrapāṇis holding blazing thunderbolt,
and produced the thought of awakening from the fear and terror (bhayabhīṭa).The
Lord at that time smiled (atha khalu bhagavān smitaṃ prādurakarot), and the venerable Ānanda
asked its meaning.Then the Lord said: “Ānanda, did you see those five hundred sons of the
Māra producing the thought of the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi)
out of fear and terror?”Ānanda said: “O Lord, I saw it.”The Lord said: “Ānanda, when the
wicked Māra attains awakening, they will also be born in the buddha-fields as bodhisatvas
having different name.”The venerable Ānanda said this to the Lord: “O Lord, when will the
wicked Māra wake up to incomparable complete awakening? What will he be called after having
attained the awakening? And what will be the name of that universe?”The Lord said: “Ānanda,
the wicked Māra, doing the works of the Māra in the buddha-fields of ten directions
again and again, will hear the dharma of destroying vices by the essence of diamond (vajragarbhakleśapramathanadharma)
from the awakened buddhas there, and will see the secret practice,
behaviour, good qualities, maintaining morality, practice, ceremony and application
of the buddhas and the bodhisatvas. Then, as long as he has faith in the thought of awakening,
he will be born [in the universe of] the tathāgata Anantāmaladhvaja, will stop doing
the works of the Māra by the teaching of [the tathāgata there], will maturate this roots
of good, and, by the thought which is no thought, in accordance with all the light of the
dharma of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmāvabhāsānugata), will produce the thought of awakening.After
that, he will serve, respect, worship, homage and give offerings to the uncountable
and innumerable tathāgatas, and will become a monk following their teachings.Having become
a monk, he will uphold the true dharma (saddharma) in the three times, and bringing innumerable
beings to maturity.After immeasurable forty-four intermediate aeons (antarakalpa),
he will wake up to incomparable complete awakening, and then in the aeon called Viśuddhi
he will be born in the Pariśuddhipratiṣṭhita universe as the tathāgata Supratiṣṭhitadharmālokalabdha,
worthy of offerings, the perfectly awakened one, perfect in wisdom and conduct
… a blessed one (supratiṣṭhitadharmālokalabdho nāma tathāgato ’rhan samyakṣaṃbuddho vidyācaraṇasaṃpannaḥ
… bhagavān).Again, Ānanda, the Pariśuddhipratiṣṭhita universe will be thriving,
prosperous, safe, well-provided, and filled with gods and men (ṛddhaś ca sphītaś ca
kṣemaś ca subhikṣaś cākīrṇadevamānuṣaś ca).Ānanda, just as whatever enjoyments (bhoga) or
entertainments (samudācāra) living beings in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha) have,
so there will be enjoyments and entertainments [in that universe.]Ānanda, the tathāgata Supratiṣṭhitadharmālokalabdha
will live to forty internal aeons (antarakalpa) together with
the great assembly of sixty-four koṭis of disciples and the congregation of twelve thousands
of bodhisatvas.O Ānanda, those who are the Māra’s sons and followers (mārakāyika) at present
will be born in the Pariśuddhipratiṣṭhita universe, will reach the complete unsurpassable
awakening, and will be predicted to attain of incomparable complete awakening by the
tathāgata Supratiṣṭhitadharmālokalabdha, namely the Māra, in his buddha-field.”

Śakrabrahmalokapāla

When that prophecy (vyākaraṇa) of the wicked Māra was set forth, all the assembly of Indras,
Brahmās and Lokapālas were astonished (āścaryaprāpta), and uttered a joyous utterance (udānam
udānayati): “Even though they have done that many works of the Māra, they still can produce
the thought of incomparable complete awakening by means of meaningfulness of seeing
the tathāgata (tathāgatāmoghadarśana). The discipline of the dharma (dharmavinaya), which
is well spoken (svākhyāta) by the Lord, is marvelous!O Lord, who is the son or daughter of
good family (kulaputrā vā kuladuhitaro vā) who could measure (pramātṛ-) the buddha-fields
(buddhakṣetra) from one person to another (pudgalena pudgalaḥ) because it cannot be measured
by any disciple or isolated buddha?”The Lord said: “So it is, friends. The sphere of
the buddha is just like what you said.However, friends, their thoughts are dependently originated,
and I see living beings who walks with desire and who stops without desire, who wears
a dharma-robe being full of impurities (saṃkleśa) and who puts on the robe without impurities
(kleśa), and who eats porridge out of greed and who stops it without appetite. O
friends, the types of behavior of living beings are so diverse.Since there are living beings
who strive for [the buddha’s] words by understanding a condensed statement (udghaṭitajñā)
or by understanding a full, detailed explanations (vipañcitajña), the tathāgata gives them
the discourses of teaching the dharma, accordingly to each individual (yathāpratyarhadharmāvatāraṇanirdeśa).O
friends, vices are neither established in place nor direction, and
they are neither a collection nor accumulated things.Vices arise superficially (ayoniśas)
but purity arises in the fundamental way (yoniśas). In that way, if you investigate the arising
of vices fundamentally, then they arise as purity.It is therefore, with this in mind,
said that, when one knows wrong views (mithyādṛṣṭi) as wrong views, namely as they really
are (yathābhūta), he will have right views (samyagdṛṣṭi).Wrong views would never be right
views, would never not be right views, would never be separated from right views. However,
if one, after having known wrong views as wrong views, is not established in them without
any action or effort, then he will enter into the way of right views, thus this is called
the right view (samyagdṛṣṭi).O friends, vices are the darkness but the purity is the light.
Vices are of weak power but the expanded vision is powerful. Vices are accidental but
its essential nature is of pure root. Vices are false imaginations but its essential nature
is the absence of false imagination (kavir3 mārṣā kleśāḥ | āloko viśuddhiḥ | durbalāḥ

is like this, friends, this great earth is based on water, water is
supported by wind, wind is founded on space, but space is dependent on nothing. Thus, among
these four elements, namely earth, water, wind, and space, space is more powerful and firmer
than any of the other elements, and is not accumulated. Since it is not accumulated,
it is neither originated nor destroyed and is stable with its own essence (tad yathā mārṣā

the contrary,] these three elements [namely, earth, water,
and wind] are endowed with origination and destruction, unstable and of no long duration.
It is perceived that these are changeable, but space is by no means changeable (tatra

that way, the parts of personality, spheres and fields of perception have
their basis in the actions and vices. The actions and vices have their basis in the superficial
mental effort. The superficial mental effort has its basis in the purity of original
nature. Therefore, it is said that the thought is basically pure but it is sullied by the
occasional vices (evam eva skandhadhātvāyatanāni karmakleśapratiṣṭhitāni | karmakleśā ayoniśomanaskārapratiṣṭhitāḥ

they are extinguished. But their original nature is of no cause nor condition. Consequently,

friends, since this is the gate into the light of the dharma (dharmālokamukha)
called Prakṛtiviśuddhimukha, the bodhisatvas, having enter into it, are not established
in the gate of any vice (sarvakleśamukha) and not proud of any pure gate as well.Since all
of them destroy haughtiness, they penetrate the suitable way (sārūpyagāminī pratipad) and
transcend all sphere of the Māra.Since they transcend the sphere of the Māra, they are
established in the sphere of the buddha.Since they are established in the sphere of the buddha,
they enter into the sphere of all beings.Since they enter into the sphere of all beings,
they do not agitate the sphere of the absolute truth (dharmadhātu).Since they are in
accordance with the sphere of the absolute truth, they obtain the omniscience (sarvajñajñāna)
by obtaining sameness and no distinction (samanirviśeṣatā).When the teaching was taught,
many bodhisatvas became free from all manifestations of mental disturbance (sarvakaukṛtyaparyutthāna),
manifestation of the hindrances [to obtain] the dharma (dharmāvaraṇaparyutthāna),
and the actions and vices (karmakleśa), and then attained the tolerance that all things
are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti).

Upāsaka Śrīgupta

gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 8Then a lay practitioner by name of Śrīgupta, having bowed down
at the Lord’s feet, addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, you set forth this exposition
of religion which is the gate into the liberation from the dharma (dharmavimuktimukhadharmaparyāya)
for me. Why is that? Lord, I tried to kill you by dropping you into a hole or by
serving poisoned food, and even though I heard many teachings from you, I was not able to
clear my doubts. However, Lord, having heard this exposition of religion, I do not have
any doubt and obtain the light of all dharmas (sarvadharmāloka).O Lord, by obtaining the light
without any regret or doubt, I will produce the thought of incomparable complete awakening
and attain distinction just like the wicked Māra.”The Lord said: “Good, very good, householder,
you fully understand the meaning of what I have preached (bhāṣitasyārtha). I prophesy
that you, having honoured, revered, venerated, and worshipped all the buddhas in the
good aeon (bhadrakalpa) with your mind and highest intension (cittādhyāśaya), will practice
the holy life (brahmacaryā) in their places, and will grasp the true dharma (saddharma).After
that, since you have pleased innumerable buddhas, after seven hundred innumerable
aeons (asaṃkhyeyakalpa), in the stainless aeon (amalakalpa), you will be born in the world
as the tathāgata Sarvaparyutthānavikiraṇa, equipped with knowledge, conduct and other qualities,
the Awakened Lord (vidyācaraṇasaṃpanno iti yāvad buddho bhagavān bhaviṣyasi).Having
heard the prophecy of the Lord concerning the incomparable complete awakening, a lay practitioner
Śrīgupta, being contented, elated, enraptured, overjoyed, exultant and jubilant
(tuṣṭodagrāttamanāḥ pramuditaḥ prītisaumanasyajātaḥ), offered all his ornaments for the body
of the Lord, and said:“O Lord, in my house I have four great treasuries, which are full
of gold and plenty of jewels.Among them, one will be given to my wife and children, male
and female slaves and workers (putradāradāsīdāsakarmakara).Another will be given to all the
poor and beggars (sarvadaridrayācanaka).A third will be given to monks coming from four
directions and the monastic communities in four directions.The other will be given to the
monastic community headed by the Buddha (buddhapramukhabhikṣusaṅgha).O Lord, as I do not
have any worldly attachment (amama) nor property (aparigraha), I pray that I may leave the
world for the well-explained discipline, be ordained, and obtain the way as a monk (labheyāhaṃ
svākhyāte dharmavinaye pravrajyām upasampadaṃ bhikṣubhāvam).”Then Śrīgupta thereupon
left the world for the well-explained discipline, was ordained, and obtained the way as a
monk.The bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “After the tathāgata become
extinguished, O Lord, who will uphold this awakening which has been established for incalculable
koṭis of aeons?”At that time, sixty koṭis of bodhisatvas, having stood up from the
congregation, joined their palms, paid homage to the Lord, and then uttered these verses
in one voice:

193 When the highest among humans was extinguished, O Lord, we will even sacrifice our bodies
and lives to uphold the true dharma..(vayam utsahāmo bhagavan nirvṛte dvipadottame |saddharma

There will be monks who, being attached to objects (ālambana), as
the messengers or partisans of the Māra (mārapakṣa), deny the true dharma (saddharma).198
Having bad morality (duḥśīla) and non-dharma (adharma), staying close to secular people, desiring
fame and gain, they will not seek the dharma.199 Being mingled with materialists (lokāyata),
praising themselves, disparaging noble ones, they will be ignorant and arrogant.200
Giving up to stay in the wilderness (araṇya), always taking pleasure among the crowds
of people (saṃsarga), practicing worldly incantations (laukikamantra), they will be attached
to [the view] that there is a permanent substance (satkāya).201 The ignorant among monks,
devoting themselves to observances, giving up to practice meditation (dhyāna), will not
act in accordance with the three jewels (triratna).202 Without learning or morality, seeking
a profit within the congregation, and exerting themselves all over the time to get gifts,
they will be full of thought-constructions (vikalpa) with distress (śoka).203 Holding
the concept of self (ātmasaṃjñā), taking pleasure in begging at the homes [of lay people]
together with friends, and entering into them, they will engage in discourses on worldly
things.204 Engaging in farming, housework, and business, having ploughs and harrows, they
will still say “We are ascetics (śramaṇa).”205 Being attached to objects (ālambana), being
established in various views (nānādṛṣṭi), after having heard the teaching of emptiness (śūnyatādharma),
they will [regard it] as the abyss (prapāta).206 Not concerned with the next
world (paraloka), giving up the fruition of actions (karmavipāka), and telling lies (mṛṣāvāda),
they will regard the non-dharma as the dharma.207 In such a time of great terror and
disruption for living beings, agitating ascetics and kings alike, we will uphold the true
dharma.(evaṃ vighe mahāghore bhikṣurājānakṣobhaṇe4 |vilopakāle satvānāṃ saddharma dhārayāmahe

O King of the dharma (dharmarāja), the Light-maker (prabhākara), when this true dharma will
be grasped, how much accumulation of merits (puṇyasaṃbhāra) will be there?

At that time, the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Even if, son of good family,
every thirty thousand world-system in the east is broken into the atomic-sized raindrops
or the atomic-sized particles, and in the same way every thirty thousand world-system in the
south, west, north, above, below and ten directions is also broken into the atomic-sized
particles, and even if the buddha-fields in east, as numerous as all the particles, are
put into one single atomic-sized particle, and in the same way, even if one calculates every
single particle in the east until it is exhausted, it would not be enough to equal with
the number of the buddha-fields,and just like in the east, the buddha-fields in each of the
ten directions are immeasurable.What do you think, son of good family (tat kiṃ manyase
kulaputra), can you calculate the particles in the ten directions, each of them contains the
buddha-fields of the ten directions in such a way? Can you understand its limit?”Gaganagañja
replied: “O Lord, nobody can do that. But the tathāgata is an exception, who knows it
by means of the unattached knowledge of the buddha (buddhāsaṅgajñāna).”The Lord said: “If,
son of good family, in all such buddha-fields there is a place in which the particles are
posited, if all the buddha-fields become a town after having been encircled by a wall,
and if the town, from its subterranean mass of water up to its highest point, is filled with
only mustard seeds without roughness, then, what do you think, son of good family, how
many mustard seeds would be there?”Gaganagañja said: “O Lord, it is marvelous that such analogy
was sought out by the tathāgata. Having heard this analogy, O Lord, those living beings
with faith will come to be endowed with a most marvelous thing (āścaryādbhutadharma).”The
Lord said: “Son of good family, how many hundreds of, how many thousands of, how many
hundred thousands of, how many vivāhas of, or how many akṣobhyas of mustard seeds there are,
or how many buddha-fields there are, how many hundreds of buddha-fields there are, how
many thousands of buddha-fields there are, or how many hundred thousands of buddha-fields
there are, all of them the tathāgata knows.Even though, son of good family, one who want to
reach awakening fills so many buddha-fields with seven kinds of precious jewels (saptaratna)
giving them as a gift for the sake of awakening, if anybody grasps the true dharma and
is established in such dharma of good qualities, then he who grasps the true dharma of one
tathāgata will generate a lot more merit.Even though one honours, reveres, worships, adores
and respects the buddhas as numerous as mustards seeds, if anybody accepts the profound
dharma (gambhīradharma), then he will generate a lot more merit.Even though one makes endless
offerings as numerous as mustard seeds, if anybody makes the seven steps (saptapada),
taking pleasure in and enduring the dharma without any hostility towards all beings (sarvasatvāpratihatacitta),
he will generate a lot more merit.Even though one [accomplishes the
works of] Indras, Brahmās, universal kings and bodhisatvas (śakrabrahmacakravartirājabodhisatva)
as numerous as mustard seeds, if anybody, who knows that all conditioned things
are impermanent and suffering (sarvaṃ saṃskṛtam anityaduḥkham), who understands that extinction
is calm (śāntaṃ nirvāṇam), engenders the great compassion for all beings (satveṣu mahākaruṇotpadyate)
and produces the thought of incomparable complete awakening for the sake
of keeping the succession of the three jewels unbroken (triratnavaṃśasyānupacchedanārthaṃ),
then he will generate a lot more merit.

VII. Transmission

Cāturmahārāja

Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, please give the tathāgata’s
blessing over this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) so that, in the latter time,
in the latter age (paścimakāle paścimasamaye), it will be disseminated and practiced
throughout the Jambūdvīpa.”The Lord said: “For that reason, son of good family, I will invoke
the Four Great Kings (cāturmahārāja) so that they will come and strive to keep this exposition
of religion for a long time (dharmaparyāyacirasthti) with detailed and analytical
explanation (vistaravibhāganirdeśa).These are the words for invoking: tadyathā | dhudhure
| dhidhire | dhvajavati | dhvajālaṃkāre | āvartani | śame śamavati | śāntimukhe | nigrahaparapakṣa
| anuttara | uttaravigama | samapatha | pathaśuddhi | pathānugama | pathasandhi
| prajñāmukhe | āryakule | bhūtarakṣa ame sacca mene sacca tama sacca tatama sacca | buddhapāda
| dharmānusandhi | āryagaṇānugama | āryanirghātani | ruṣṭaprāsādani | īśvarapadalokacittikṛte
| anurāgayantu | imān dharmasandhi | vibhajantu nirukte | nirdeśe pratirakṣantu
| dharmadhāraṇī |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the Four Great Kings.”Then
the Four Great Kings, having become scared and fearful (bhayabhīṭa), approached the
Lord, prostrated themselves at the Lord’s feet, and said this to the Lord:“O Lord, we, the
Four Great Kings will protect, shield, guard (rakṣāvaraṇagupti) this exposition of religion
(dharmaparyāya) so that it may last long and be beneficial.Wherever this exposition of
religion is practiced, if there are devas, nāgas, yakśas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas or
kiṃnaras (devanāgayakṣagandharvāsuragaruḍakinnara) who want the destruction of the dharma,
we will subjugate them.Whosoever seek for the dharma, we will make them happy.We will offer
hospitality to the congregation of the dharma-reciter (dharmabhāṇakaparṣanmaṇḍala), never
forget the meaning of the words to be connected to the words (padānusaṃdhyasaṃpramoṣatā),
give inspiration (pratibhāna), and increase recollection, intelligence, understanding and
happiness (smṛtimatiprativedhamuditā).At these words, the Lord said this to the Four Great
Kings: “Excellent, excellent, friends, you are my sons born of the dharma, and all of
you demonstrate the effort to uphold my true dharma (saddharmaparigraha). With the outcome
of the dharma (dharmaniṣyanda) all of you will be the masters of the world in this world,
and after having transcended all the world, you will attain the final extinction (nirvāṇa)
in the realm of noble extinction (āryanirvāṇadhātu).”

Śakra Devānām Indra

Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, I will invoke Śakra,
the lord of the gods (śakro devānām indraḥ), and by pronouncing the knowledge-mantra
(vidyāmantra) he will remain for protecting this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) so
that it may last long. The mantra is as follows:tadyathā | śubhe | śubhamati | śubhavyūhe
| dudare |13 daride |14 duraṇi | dame śame | upaśame | khube | ugaśame | khabe | ugakhare
| asomukhe | dhāraṇi | araddi | suśruṣe | sahite | abhede bhedadandhi saume samavati samarasmi
| aśe | huhu | hehe | khurukhure | anatikrame | devarakṣasahe he mahābhāvabhāsabrame
| āgacchatu śakro devānāṃ | mantradaśaśatanayena15 | brahmakuṭadhāra | īśvara umarut babhana
nivasi |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the lord of gods by which
he will be invoked and remain for this exposition of religion to last long.”Because of the
impact of the dharma (dharmapravega), the lord of the gods became full of happiness and
all his dwelling places in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven were shaken. Then, together with many hundreds
of thousands of attendant gods, he approached to the Lord, prostrated himself at the
Lord’s feet, and said this to the Lord:“O Lord, I am Śakra, the lord of gods, who have
the mastery of the gods in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. Together with a multitude of attendant
gods, I will strive to disseminate this exposition of religion throughout the Jambūdvīpa.I
will never do violence to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) who retain this sūtra, delight
in them, have faith in them, and adorn them by adornments of the dharma. Wherever they
teach this exposition of religion in a village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama),
kingdom (rāṣṭra) or capital (rājadhāni), I will protect, shield and guard them.O Lord, I will
go to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) in order to listen the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa).[Even
if someone] insults or abuses [the preachers of the dharma,] I will make him accept
them.16I will protect, shield and guard them from the harmful obstruction of Māra.”The Lord
said: “Excellent, excellent, Kauśika, since you have obtained the power of gods, you,
having entered into the power of the dharma, will roar the lion’s road (siṃhanādanādi) in
order to uphold all the buddha’s true dharma (saddharma).Why is that? Kauśika, if you uphold
the true dharma of one tathāgata, then you are also upholding the true dharma of the Awakened
Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).”

Brahmā Sahāṃpati

Then the Lord said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Then, son of good family, I will invoke the
Brahmā, the lord of Sahā (brahmā sahāṃpati), and because of that he will continue protecting
this exposition of religion. The words of invoking is as follows:tadyathā | maitre |
śubhamaitre | dharmamaitre | maitryānusahite samaitre | sandhimaitre | anugamamaitre | anugacchamaitre
| anuttāramaitre | sātramaitre | dharmamaitre | anugrahamaitre | apratisārimaitre
| ullalokanamaitre17 | vilokanamaitre | vilokanamaitre | bebhyaḥ anugamanamaitre | buddhādhiṣṭḥānamaitre
| anurāgākṣamaitre | anurāgākṣamaitre | dharmapratisāraṇamaitre | mokṣamaitre
| o no o no nur oṃ dhe | virodhamaitre | o to mo maitre | brahmapathamaitre | dhyānālaṃkaramaitre
| tasyānusandhikāruṇamaitre | tasyānusandhimutiṭāmaitre | tasya sānusanddhi
| upekṣāmaitre | brahmapathānugamanamaitre | ciita utstsi la lyamaitre | anusāraṇamaitre
| nistiraṅamaitre | sarvatānugamanamaitre | āgacchatu brahma | udprijya | dānasukena | vyūtiṣṭhāsvamadhye|
nitramamahāvimanāda | viavalokāya | jambudvipanakuruśādharmarakṣāna | mātikramabuddhādhiṣṭhānāṃ
|Those treasuries of open space are the words of invoking the Brahā,
the lord of Sahā.”Then the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, dwelling in the heaven of Brahmā
(brahmaloka), became aware of the presence of the buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna), heard these words
of friendly mantra (maitrīmantra) by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva), namely the
sphere of divine hearing (divyaśrotradhātu), together with sixty-eight hundred thousand
Brahmās, approached to the Lord, prostrated himself at the Lord’s feet, and sat down on a
side.Having sat down on a side, the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, addressed himself to the Lord:
“O Lord, since we are sustained by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhita),
we will be endowed with friendliness and compassion (maitrīkaruṇā) and strive for
this exposition of religion.As for the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka), who, having collected
this teaching of the buddha, understand it, retain it, read it, teach it, and make it
into a book (pustaka), wherever they hold religious discourses (dharmakathā) in the wilderness
(araṇya), forest (utpathamārga), village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama), kingdom
(rāṣṭra) or capital (rājadhāni), if they explain this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya)
in detail, then we will protect them, shield them, guard them, rejoice them, fulfill
energy (bala), attain recollection (smṛti), acquire intelligence (mati), be accordance
with realization (prativedha), fulfill eloquence (pratibhāna), inspire the unbelieving with
faith, and liberate those who have faith. According to the tathāgata’s guiding principle
of the dharma (tathāgatadharmanaya), Lord, we will uphold and disseminate it”At these words,
the Lord said this to the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā: “Excellent, excellent, Brahmā, since
you uphold the true dharma, the tathāgata rejoices in you.Just as I am turning the wheel
of the dharma (dharmacakra), just so, Brahmā, you also will before long turn it.Just as
you are upholding my true dharma, just so other Brahmās will uphold your true dharma.”

Bodhisatva Maitreya

Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Maitreya: “O Maitreya, I entrust
(parindāmi) you with this [teaching of] incomparable complete awakening, which has been established
for countless hundreds of millions of aeons, in order that it will be memorized,
understood, read, and elucidated in detail to others, in order to give thanks and gratitude
to the tathāgata, fulfill my aspirations (abhiprāya), increase and purify many beings’
roots of good (kuśalamūla), make the bodhisatvas attain the light of the dharma (dharmāloka),
subjugate all Māras, defeat all heretics (tīrthika), uphold the dharma of the highest
meaning (paramārthadharma), and in order not to break the continuity of the three jewels (triratnavaṃśānupaccheda).”At
these words, the bodhisatva Maitreya addressed himself to the
Lord: “O Lord, I will protect this unexcelled treasury of the Dharma Jewel (anuttaradharmaratnanidhāna)
for the sake of the complete extinction of the tathāgata (tathāgataparinirvāṇa).Why
is that? Because, Lord, this is the true dharma (saddharma) of myself and the Awakened
Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).O Lord, when I have
dwelled in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha), I have strived for protecting, upholding,
and keeping these sūtras for a long time.O Lord, in the latter time, in the latter age (paścimakāle
paścimasameye), if someone were to hear this true sūtra, grasp it, retain it,
recite it, fully explain it to others, and practice it himself, may you know that it is because
of the sustaining power of maitreya (maitreyādhiṣṭhāna).If, Lord, the partisans of the
Māra were to attack, even further, if the root of goods were to fill up every pore of my
whole body, and then if all living beings in the world system of three thousand worlds were
to become the wicked Māras, they do not approach even a hundredth part of the root of
goods in one of the pores and so on, until nor do they approach even the likeness of it (ekaromakūpasya
kuśalamūlaḥ śatatamīm api kalāṃ nopaiti yāvad upamām api nopaiti).O Lord, as
all regions of Māras (sarvamāramaṇḍala) were conquered by the power of my merits (puṇyabala)
and the power of my knowledge (jñānabala), this awakening will be protected by the tathāgata
for countless millions.”The Lord said: “Good, good, Maitreya, these four are the bodhisatva’s
actions. What four? 1) conquering all Māras and vices (sarvamārakleśanigraha);
2) defeating all opponents (sarvaparapravādin) in accordance with the dharma (dharmānulomikābhibhava);
3) bringing all beings to maturity (satvaparipācana); 4) upholding the true dharma
(saddharmaparigraha).Those four actions are belonging to one, namely, upholding the
true dharma (saddharmaparigraha).”

Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda

Then the Lord said this to the elder Mahākāśyapa and the venerable Ānanda: “Mahākāśyapa and
Ānanda, I entrust (parindāmi) you with this [teaching of] incomparable complete awakening
so that it will be memorized, understood, read and elucidated to others.”The Mahākāśyapa said:
“O Lord, we will uphold this awakening of the tathāgata with all my might.”The Ānanda
said: “O Lord, we will take up this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) and disseminate
it by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhāna).”

Bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra

Then the bodhisatva, the great being Puṇyālaṃkāra addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, what
the Lord had said (tathāgatabhāṣita) in this sūtra is deep and profound in illumination,
free from mental activity (pracāra), difficult to see its explicit meaning (nītārthadurdṛśya),
difficult to understand (duradhigamya), endowed with the higher truth (paramārtha),
namely emptiness (śūnyatā), adorned with the adornment of morality (śīlālaṃkārālaṃkṛta), producing
recollection (smṛti), concentration (samādhi), penetration (nirvedhika) and happiness
in thought (manaspraharṣaṇa), illuminating the light of insight (prajñāraśmi), revealing
liberation (vimukti), peaceful, unsullied, known by the wise and accomplished ones, praised
and extolled by all buddhas (sarvabuddhasaṃstutapraśasta), sealed with the seal of the
king of memory and sūtras (dhāraṇīsūtrāntarājamudrāmudrita), grasping the unhindered eloquence
(apratihatapratibhānagrahaṇa), increasing recollection, intelligence, understanding
and confidence (smṛtimatiprativedhādhimuktivivardhana), not surpassed by any Māra or adversary
(sarvamārapratyarthikānabhibhūta), rebuking immoral beings (duḥśīla), established in
the dharma which is the qualities of purity, austerity, fulfilling vows and the qualities
of giving (dhūtaguṇasaṃlekhasaṃvaraniryātatyāgaguṇadharmapratiṣṭhita), and originated from
endless good merits (anantaguṇadharmanirjāta). If sons of good family or daughters of good
family were to bear this teaching and knowledge of all the buddhas in their minds, grasp
it, retain it, read it, master it, elucidate it to others, write it, copy it, recite it,
think about it, examine it, reflect on it, and be established in the progress (pratipattipratiṣṭhita),
then how much merit (puṇya) they will generate?”Then the Lord spoke the following
verses to the bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra:

233 Even though the bodhisatva sees immeasurably extensive fields in ten directions by the eye
of the buddha (buddhalocanā), fills all those places with jewels, and gives them as a gift,
if there is someone who retains, reads and teaches such excellent and unsullied sūtra
which has been taught by many buddhas, then his merit would be better.234 Even though the
bodhisatva fills all those fields with flowers (puṣpa), fragrances (sugandha), ointments
(vilepana), parasols (chattra), flags (patākā), banners (dhvaja) and wreath s of cloth, and
makes an offering to the buddhas, if there is someone taking care of the true dharma (saddharma)
to be grasped at the time of the disintegration and cessation of the dharma of the
Well-gone One (sugata), then his merit would be better.235 Even though the bodhisatva places
a lamp (pradīpa) on shrines (caitya) dedicated to the Victorious One (jina), which is
filled with perfumed oil like the ocean (sāgara) in ten directions and made of a wick (varti)
like the Mt. Sumeru, if there is someone who, having known that the whole world is covered
by darkness (andhakāra), upholds this dharma taught by the Victorious One when the lamp
of the dharma (dharmapradīpa) is extinguished, then his merit would be better.236 Even
though the bodhisatva, seeking the highest awakening (agrabodhi) of the buddha, seeing the
leaders (nāyaka) in ten millions of fields, has offered beautiful [clothes] made of silk
for many millions of aeons, if there is someone who, giving thanks to the buddha, upholding
(anugraha) the three jewels (triratna), grasps the true dharma (saddharma) to be apprehended
by living beings, then his merit would be better.237 In the same way that I grasp the
dharma of the protectors (nātha), I see living beings by the eye of the buddha (buddhalocanā)
and teach them to be Śakras or Brahmās, but it does not increase merit that much. Even
though I teach all those beings to be the worthy ones (arhat) or to mount on the vehicle
of the isolated buddha (pratyekayāna), if there is someone who, having generated the thought
of awakening (bodhicitta), upholds the true dharma (saddharma), then it would be better
(viśiṣṭa).238 If his merit has a material form, all the fields in ten direction would be
filled up with it, and there would be no vessel [to contain that merit] except for the the
knowledge of the best of men (puruṣarṣabhajñāna). Just as, even if one expresses the knowledge
of the buddha (buddhajñāna) for ten thousand aeons, there will be no end, just so
it is impossible to measure the merit of upholding the true dharma of the tathāgata.

Then the bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra, having heard this teaching on the merit of upholding the true
dharma from the Lord, became contented, elated, enraptured, overjoyed, exultant and jubilant
(tuṣṭodagrāttamanāḥ pramuditaḥ prītisaumanasyajāto bhavati), and addressed himself
to the Lord:“O Lord, the bodhisatvas, who do not strive for upholding the true dharma, will
be beset by the Māra (mārādhiṣṭhita).If, O Lord, there are bodhisatvas who [have planted]
all other roots of good without upholding the true dharma, their merits would be merely
as a mustard seed (sarṣapa).The roots of good stemming from upholding the true dharma are
established in the conception of a self (ātmasaṃjñā), which is exactly the same as the sphere
of space (gaganadhātu) in ten directions.In order to seek for the happiness of all living
beings (sarvasatvasukha), O Lord, I will give up my body and soul (kāyajīvita), and, without
desiring any happiness for me, will put on the armour for the sake of upholding the
true dharma.”When this exposition of religion was set forth, due to the maturation of the
bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s merit, in order to pay homage (pūjākarmaṇa) to this exposition of
religion (dharmaparyāya), the bodhisatvas, who have the same thoughts with the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja, dwelling in immeasurable buddha-fields in ten directions, poured down the rain
of flowers (puṣpavarṣa) from the vault of the sky.Then this sound resonated in open space:
“While adorning and upholding this chapter of the Great Collection (mahāsaṃnipātaparivarta),
the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja has done the buddha-activities (buddhakārya).The
living beings who are not separated from the thought of awakening (bodhicittāviyukta)
will uphold this exposition of religion, and in the same way, they will adorn the true
dharma.”Then at that time, the Lord emitted such light from his body, thereby all buddha-fileds
in ten directions became filled with it.When the beginning, middle and end of this
exposition of religion was set forth, immeasurable, incalculable living beings produced
the thought of awakening, and attained the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti).]Some
of their thoughts were liberated, some of them attained the eyes of
the dharma (dharmacakṣuḥ), some of them became free from desire, some of them acquired the
good qualities of gods and men (devamanuṣyasaṃpatti) and gathered causes for seeing other
buddhas, and even the Lord was pleased with all of them.As the Lord had uttered these words,
the bodhisatva great being Gaganagañja, the bodhisatva great being Maitreya, the bodhisatva
great being Kutūhalajāta, the bodhisatva great being Ratnapāṇi, the bodhisatva great
being Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva great being Guṇarājaprabhāsa, the bodhisatva great being
Puṇyālaṃkāra, the bodhisatva great being Apāyajaha, the bodhisatva great being Dharmarāja,
the venerable Śāriputra, the venerable Mahākāśyapa, the venerable Ānanda, the Brahmā king
of Sahā, Śakra king of the gods, the Four Great Kings, the monks, the bodhisatvas, the whole
of that assembly, and the world with its gods, human beings, anti-gods and gandharvas
praised what the Lord had preached (idam avocad bhagavān āttamanā gaganagañjo bodhisatvo
mahāsatvaḥ ca maitreyo bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca kutūhalajāto bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca ratnapāṇir
bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca mañjuśrīr bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca guṇarājaprabhāso bodhisatvo
