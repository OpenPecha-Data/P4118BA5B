123 There is a principle that minds and all dharmas are just like open space. Listen to my instruction
of entering into the [principle,] step by step (krameṇa).124 Just as there is no
high or low in open space, so there is no superior or inferior in the nature of the dharma
(dharmatā), then how could we pay respect something else [except for open space]?125 Just
as there is not any origination nor cessation perceived in open space, so there is no thought-construction
(vikalpa) in all dharmas which are unborn.126 Just as there is no decreasing
or increasing perceived in open space, so all dharmas do not increase or decrease.127
Just as there is no darkness or defilement, the nature of mind (cittaprakṛti) is luminous,
thus it is undefiled.128 Just as open space is not delighted even by the sunlight or moonlight,
our thoughts are also not agitated by anything.129 Just as open space is not damaged
in the hail of spears and arrows, so the Son of the Victorious One (jinaputra) is not
afflicted by any suffering coming from all directions.130 Just as the open space is not delighted
by the rain of ambrosia (amṛtavarṣa), the bodhisatva is not pleased with any gain
or honour (lābhasatkāra).131 Just as the open space never makes discriminative construction
on praise or blame, so the bodhisatva is stable and unwavering in pleasure and suffering
(sukhaduḥka).132 Just as the open space is never shaken while the whole ground is shaking,
just so the bodhisatva is never agitated while this world is shaking.133 Just as the open
space is not burnt even when the fire breaks out at the end of the aeon (kalpoddāha), so
the bodhisatva is stable and is not burnt by any vice (kleśa).134 Just as the open space
remains without birth or death, so all dharmas remains in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu)
without going or coming.135 Just as all manifestations of forms (rūpāvabhāsa) appear in
open space, so all manifestations of dharmas (dharmāvabhāsa) appear in the absolute reality
(dharmadhātu).136 Due to the absence of distinguishing marks and form, the open space
cannot be seen. When you understand the nature of thoughts in this way, it will be like the
open space.137 The open space is only a name (nāmamātra), without color and form (varṇasaṃsthāna),
in the same way, thought, mind, and consciousness (cittamanovijñāna) are illustrated
(paridīpita) by name.138 Just as the open space is boundless and ungraspable (agrāhya)
everywhere, the great power of insight (prajñāmahānubhāva) is the same as the sameness
of open space (gaganasamasadṛśa).139 Just as a bird flying in the sky does not leave any trace,
one who practices for awakening does not have any distinguishing mark (nimitta) in their
behaviour.140 Just as, the body is originally the same as open space, so the essential
nature of the parts of personality (skandhasvabhāva) is the same as open space.141 It is
said that the four elements (caturdhātu) are the same as open space, in the same way, even
in the fire at the end of the aeon (kalpoddāha), these elements are still same as the open
space.142 Just as the open space cannot be filled up with even all beings, so the series
of thoughts (cittasaṃtāna) also cannot be filled up with all objects of sense (sarvaviṣaya).143
The great words with the lion’s roar (siṃhanāda), the words given by the protector
of the world (lokanātha), and the supermundane insight (lokottaraprajñā), you should find
satisfaction in these teachings.144 Just as the end of the open space cannot be perceived
because it is too extensive (vipula), just so the teachings of the buddha also cannot be
attained.145 All dharmas are the buddha. He who knows this truth will not destroy existence
nor remain in existence.146 The wise, discerning existence and non-existence (bhāvābhāva),
remain in the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), but never take the view of existence or non-existence.147
Even though emptiness (śūnyatā) is proclaimed by sound (śabda), but emptiness
is not in the sound. It is beyond sound and inexpressible, thus it is called ‘emptiness.’148
Even though all buddhas teach emptiness (śūnyatā), it is inexpressible. That is called
emptiness, thus its meaning (artha) is also inexpressible.149 By using metaphors such as
illusion, mirage, dream, reflection, echo, etc. (māyāmarīcisvapnapratibhāsapratiśrutkādi),
the leaders (nāyaka) teach the dharma.150 In order to lead many beings, metaphors are taught.
In this peaceful dharmas, there is no obstacle (pratipakṣa) perceived.151 Even though
all dharmas are without essential character (alakṣaṇa), it is taught by its essential character.
Something characterized or something not characterized (lakṣyālakṣya), anything
does not exist in the the absolute reality (dharmadhātu).152 What to be characterized (lakṣya)
has the character of open space (gaganalakṣaṇa), and the character of open space is not
found. Those who fully understand this principle are the bodhisatvas.153 He, who is not
attached nor bound even to the smallest thing, who is without activity (aprapañca), and who
is free from discursive thinking (niḥprapañca), is called the bodhisatva.154 He who is
not separated from living beings, who remains among living beings, and who understand the
nature of living beings (satvasvabhāva) is called the bodhisatva.155 Having heard that living
beings are originally extinguished, not being afraid of that, such is the armor (saṃnāha)
of heroes, the entrance of awakening.156 Even if a magician, after having created many
creatures, killed them all, there was no killing; the essential character of living beings
is exactly like that.157 The natures of illusion, living beings, extinction, and the buddha
(māyāsatvanirvāṇabuddha) have one essence, and he understands the own nature is the absence
of the nature.158 The bodhisatva Gaganagañja has attained the imperishable treasury
(akṣayagañja) from the open space, thus this treasury will not be exhausted, even while satisfying
all living beings.159 Since the stream (nadī) of immeasurable merits (puṇya) purifies
this treasury, in the imperishability of all dharmas, you should see the true state of
all dharmas (dharmāṇāṃ dharmatā).160 If you understand that all dharmas have arisen from
causes, their treasury will be inexhaustible, and the treasury of the dharma (dharmagañja)
will be inconceivable.161 The protector of the world (lokanātha) has taught the inexhaustibility
(akṣayatā) of these four dharmas, to wit, living beings (satva), open space (gagana),
the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), and the dharma of the Buddha (buddhadharma).162
If those were material things, those will be exhausted; but since those are not material
things, those are inexhaustible, thus it is called ‘inexhaustible.’163 Since the dharma is
momentary, even if the dharma is consumed, it would never be exhausted. There is nothing
exhausted in that inexhaustibility, thus it is called ‘inexhaustibility (akṣayatā).’164 The
bodhisatva, who understands this teaching of the dharma (dharmadeśanā), will attain awakening
without any difficulty and enter into awakening.

When this versified teaching was taught, one hundred thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance
that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti),and twelve thousand sons of gods
(devaputra) dwelling in the vault of the open space (gaganatala) generated the thought of
incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).

Kutūhalajāta

At that time, the bodhisatva, the great being Kutūhalajāta came and sat down in this assembly,
addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, thinking about where this sound [of the dharma
(dharmaśabda)] is coming from (niścar-), I am absolutely astonished (āścaryaprāpta).”The Lord
said: “Son of good family, you should ask the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, and he will answer
to you.”The bodhisatva Kutūhalajāta said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family,
I am absolutely astonished (kutūhalajāta), thinking about where this sound [of the dharma
(dharmaśabda)] is coming from.”Gaganagañja said: “What do you think, son of good family
(tat kiṃ manyase kulaputra)? Where is an echo (pratiśrutkā)coming from?”Kutūhalajāta said:
“Son of good family, the sound of an echo comes from the sound uttered by another person
(paraśabdavijñapti).”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, does an echo (pratiśrutkā)
have body, thought, form, color, or shape (kāyacittarūpavarṇasaṃsthāna)?Kutūhalajāta said:
“No, son of good family.”Gaganagañja said: “Quite so, son of good family. Just as an echo
does not really exist (apariniṣpanna) and it is merely the perception of sounds (śabdasaṃprāpaṇa),
in the same way, [the sound of the dharma coming from] open space does not really
exist and it is also the perception of sounds.”Kutūhalajāta said: “Son of good family,
who perceives this sound? where is this sound coming from?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good
family, the recognition of knowledge (jñānaprativijñapti) is incomprehensible. Even though
we think that it is coming from this open space because of the reflection of our mind, it
is neither going nor coming. The resonance of sound is just coming.Son of good family, you
should examine its profoundness (gaṃbhīra) in the perspective of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda).Even
though the result arises from the causes, the causes is not transferred
to the attainment of fruits (phalodaya), but when there is no cause, there is no arising
of result.That is to say, this dharma is produced as a result (phala) from causes and
conditions (hetupratyaya), but even so there is no activity (āniṃjya) nor agent (kāraka)
in them.Those who perceive things thus are beyond the fruition of causes (visāmagrī).Why is
that? This is because the Lord said that understanding defilements (saṃkleśa) is purification
(vyavadāna); suppressing defilements (saṃkleśasaṃghāta) is not purification as the essential
character (svabhāvalakṣaṇa) of defilement is purification.In fact, both defilement
and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna) are just conventional expressions (saṃketapada).Defilement
and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna) are not apprehended within the limit of the ultimate
truth (paramārthakoṭi).Since the limit of the ultimate truth is beyond limit (akoṭi),
that which is beyond limit is the true limit (bhūtakoṭi).The true limit (bhūtakoṭi) is
the limit of emptiness (śūnyatākoṭi).The the limit of emptiness (śūnyatākoṭi) is the limit
of the self (ātmakoṭi).The limit of the self is the limit of all dharmas (sarvadharmakoṭi).Why
is that? Concerning all dharmas, the limit of them, the limit of emptiness, and the
limit of tranquility; being unattached to the gate into these three limits is attaining the
unattached knowledge to any dharma.Then Śāriputra the Elder addressed himself to the bodhisatva
Kutūhalajāta: “Son of good family, why are you called Kutūhalajāta?”Kutūhalajāta
said: “Venerable Śāriputra, wherever you have wished and struggled for the dharma, have you
wondered about it?”Śāriputra said: “Quite so, son of good family.”Kutūhalajāta said: “In
the same way, Venerable Śāriputra, I have wished and struggled for all dharmas here and there,
but I still wonder about when I can fulfill all the qualities of the buddha. That is
why I am called Kutūhalajāta.I wonder about all practices of the bodhisatva (sarvabodhisatvacaryā)
and the knowledge of entering into the thoughts and deeds of all living beings (sarvasatvacittacaritāpraveśajñāna).
That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.What I wonder about
is without any knowledge or any entrance. That is way I called Kutūhalajāta.That on which
I wonder about is without weak point (avatāra) concerning any vice (sarvakleśa) or any
work of Māra (sarvamārakarma). That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.”Then the Śāriputra the
Elder addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, even though this name of good person proclaims
and teaches all dharmas of the buddha, he is not attached to any dharma of the buddha.
It is a wonderful to teach all dharmas of the buddha without any attachment.”

Ratnaśrī

Then the bodhisatva, Ratnaśrī by name, came and sat down in this assembly, said to the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja:“With reference to the teaching of concentration (samādhiprakāśanam ārabhya),
son of good family, may you elucidate (pratibhātu) what kind of concentration should
be purified (samādhipariśodhana).Thus addressed (evam ukte), the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said
this to the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī:
