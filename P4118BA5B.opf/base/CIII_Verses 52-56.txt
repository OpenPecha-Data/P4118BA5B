Then, in order to clarify this point further, the Lord went on to speak these verses: (atha
khalu tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata)

52 The knowledge of cessation (kṣayajñāna) is imperishable (akṣaya) and pure patience since
the mind is cultivated without any attachment to any object.Patience becomes the highest thought
like empty space when its outside and inside (adhyātmabhāhya) are pure and it fixed
anywhere.

53 This body (kāya) is just as a reflection, grass, tree, and wall, (pratibhāsatṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyasadṛśa)
and thought (citta) is formless and invisible like as illusion (māyā).This dharma
is like empty space, since having no particular basis. Thus body is changeless (avikāra)
and mind has no anger (apratighāta).

54 Homage (satkāra) should be beyond attachment and ill-will, it should not discriminate (vikḷp)
between superior, inferior.The religious way (yāna) which is just like the ground and
threshold (indrakīla), teaches patience in order to purify living beings.

55 Enduring the fact that all dharmas are empty since there is no life, individual self, or
living being (nirjīvaniḥsvapudgalaniḥsatva), and not inconsistent with causes, conditions,
and effects (hetupratyayakāryāvirodha). Such is the most true and highest exposition of patience.

56 Never responding to the words of abuse, and never getting angry like the thundercloud (meghasvara)
in the sky.With a mind purified of self, seeing absolute emptiness, in this teaching
I preach patience in order to purify living beings.

4. VīryaHow, son of good family, does the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space
(kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya vīryaṃ gaganasamam)?
