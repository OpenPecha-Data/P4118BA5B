16. CaritalakṣaṇaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva know1 the essential character
of behaviour of all living beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇa)?There, son of good family,
are eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour of living beings (caturaśītisatvacaritasahasra),
and these are the basic words of a summary (mūloddānapada).The behaviour of all living
beings, which is immeasureable (sarvasatvacaritāpramāṇa), unthinkable (acintya), and ineffable
(anabhilāpya), is known by the knowledge of a Buddha (buddhajñāna), but not by the
knowledge of the disciples, the isolated buddhas (śrāvakapratyekabuddhajñāna), or the knowledge
of bodhisatva (bodhisatvajñāna).Thus the bodhisatva penetrates the essential character
of behaviour of all living beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇānupraveśa) through the presence
of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhāna) and his own knowledge (ātmajñāna).The behaviour’s essence
(svabhāva), essential character (lakṣaṇa), the essential character of cause (hetulakṣaṇa),
the essential character of condition (pratyayalakṣaṇa), the essential character of productive
cause (karaṇahetulakṣaṇa), the essential character of combination (sāmagrīlakṣaṇa),
the essential character of difference (nānātvalakṣaṇa), the essential character of discordance
(vilakṣaṇa), the essential character of passion (rāgalakṣaṇa), the essential character
of aversion (dveṣalakṣaṇa), the essential character of delusion (mohalakṣaṇa), the essential
character of the three together (sabhāgalakṣaṇa), the essential character of hell-beings
(nirayalakṣaṇa), the animal world (tiryagyonilakṣaṇa), the essential character of the
world of the lord of death (yamalokalakṣaṇa), the essential character of gods (devalakṣaṇa),
the essential character of human being (manuṣyalakṣaṇa), the essential character of
the entrance into the fixed course of disciples (śrāvakaniyāmāvakranti), the essential character
of the entrance into the fixed course of isolated buddhas (pratyekabuddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa),
the essential character of the entrance into the fixed course of the buddhas (buddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa),
the essential character of distant cause, the essential character of intermediate
cause (anantaryalakṣaṇa), and the essential character of immediate cause - he knows
all the essential characters of behaviour truly as they are (yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti), and
there is no fault at all (anavadya) in his understanding (sarvajñāna).
