17. DharmaratnanidhānaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva grasp the treasury of
the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords?Son of good family, the treasury
of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords is imperishable (akṣaya).Thus,
as many as are the entrances into the essential character of behaviour in all living
beings, so many are the entrances into knowledge which is the gate into the treasury of
the Dharma Jewel of the Awakened Lords (yāvantaḥ sarvasatvānāṃ caritalakṣaṇānupraveśās tāvad
api buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānamukhajñānapraveśāḥ).Just as the behaviour
of living beings is imperishable and endless, in the same way, the treasury of the Dharma
Jewel of the Awakened Lords is also imperishable and endless (yathā satvacaritam akṣayam anatam
evam api buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānāny akṣayāṇi anatāni).From the night
(rātri) when the Tathāgata attained awakening (bodhiprāpta) to the night of his extinction
(parinirvāṇa), the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) has been explained,
is being explained, and will be explained by the Tathāgata. All of them are what they really
are (tathatā), not different from what they are (avitathatā), and nothing else but what
they are (ananyathā).Why is it called ‘such’ (kasmāt tatheti)? Since it is the entrance into
the peace of suchness, it is called 'such’ (tathatāśāntisaṃprasthitatvāt tatheti).Why
is it called ‘suchness without error’ (kasmāt avitatheti)? Since it is the entrance into the
highest truth, it is called ‘suchness without error.’ (paramārthasatyasaṃprasthitatvāt
tatheti)Why is it called ‘suchness that is not other’ (kasmāt ananyatatheti)? Since he seeks
nothing else but the essential nature (svabhāva), there is no other.Further, as for the
treasury of the Dharma Jewels of the Awakened Lords, even though living beings of a system
of threefold thousand great thousand worlds (trisāhasramahāsahasralokadhātuparyāpanna) were
as learned as (bāhuśruta) Ānanda, all of them would not be able to understand even a syllable
(akṣara) in hundreds of thousands of millions of aeons (kalpakoṭīśatasahasra); and
further they would not be able to teach even a single meaning (ekārtha) - such a true teaching
(yathābhūtadeśanā) is the treasury of Dharma Jewels belonging to the Awakened Lords.The
bodhisatvas, having grasped it, do not forget (saṃpramoṣayati) any letter or lose any
meaning (artha), and they please (ārādhyati) all living beings, gratify (ārāgayati) all the
Buddhas, vanquish all the Evil Ones (sarvamāra), subjugate all other heretics (sarvānyatīrthika),
and appease all vices (sarvakleśa). Thus they understand the Dharma Jewel Words.In
this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva grasps the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna)
of the Awakened Lords.
