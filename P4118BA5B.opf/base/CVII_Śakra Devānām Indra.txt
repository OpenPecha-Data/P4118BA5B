Śakra Devānām Indra

Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, I will invoke Śakra,
the lord of the gods (śakro devānām indraḥ), and by pronouncing the knowledge-mantra
(vidyāmantra) he will remain for protecting this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) so
that it may last long. The mantra is as follows:tadyathā | śubhe | śubhamati | śubhavyūhe
| dudare |1 daride |2 duraṇi | dame śame | upaśame | khube | ugaśame | khabe | ugakhare |
asomukhe | dhāraṇi | araddi | suśruṣe | sahite | abhede bhedadandhi saume samavati samarasmi
| aśe | huhu | hehe | khurukhure | anatikrame | devarakṣasahe he mahābhāvabhāsabrame |
āgacchatu śakro devānāṃ | mantradaśaśatanayena3 | brahmakuṭadhāra | īśvara umarut babhana
nivasi |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the lord of gods by which he
will be invoked and remain for this exposition of religion to last long.”Because of the impact
of the dharma (dharmapravega), the lord of the gods became full of happiness and all
his dwelling places in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven were shaken. Then, together with many hundreds
of thousands of attendant gods, he approached to the Lord, prostrated himself at the
Lord’s feet, and said this to the Lord:“O Lord, I am Śakra, the lord of gods, who have the
mastery of the gods in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. Together with a multitude of attendant gods,
I will strive to disseminate this exposition of religion throughout the Jambūdvīpa.I will
never do violence to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) who retain this sūtra, delight
in them, have faith in them, and adorn them by adornments of the dharma. Wherever they teach
this exposition of religion in a village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama), kingdom
(rāṣṭra) or capital (rājadhāni), I will protect, shield and guard them.O Lord, I will
go to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) in order to listen the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa).[Even
if someone] insults or abuses [the preachers of the dharma,] I will make him accept them.4I
will protect, shield and guard them from the harmful obstruction of Māra.”The Lord
said: “Excellent, excellent, Kauśika, since you have obtained the power of gods, you, having
entered into the power of the dharma, will roar the lion’s road (siṃhanādanādi) in order
to uphold all the buddha’s true dharma (saddharma).Why is that? Kauśika, if you uphold the
true dharma of one tathāgata, then you are also upholding the true dharma of the Awakened
Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).”
