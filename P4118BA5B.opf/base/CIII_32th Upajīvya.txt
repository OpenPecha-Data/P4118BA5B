32. SatvopajīvyaHow then, son of good family, the bodhisatva, having accumulated immeasurable
merits (aprameyapuṇyopacaya), nourishes all living beings (satvopajīvya)?.Son of good family,
the bodhisatva practices friendliness (matrī) to all living beings;he practices compassion
(karuṇā) to all creatures;he is not attached to anything in particular in his meditations
(dhyāneṣu atanmayavihāritā);he gives away all his possessions to beggars (yācanakeṣu
sarvasvaparityāgatā);his pleasure is imperishable (akṣayabhoga) through his merits (puṇya);he
is always committed to his intension (āśaya) by the purity of morality (śīlapariśuddhi);his
thoughts are like an earth (pṛthivīsama) since there is no high or low (natonnata)
in his mind;he is free from thoughts by pure morality (śīlapariśuddhi);his thought is liberated
(cittamukta) and the gate is free from hinderance (mukhānāvṛta) by accomplishing all
sacrifices (sarvayajñapratipatti);he has perfected memory and eloquence (dhāraṇīpratibhānasaṃpanna)
by investigating the dharma (dharmapravicaya);he depends on the knowledge of supernatural
powers (abhijñājñānāśrita) by going to immeasurable Buddha-fields (aprameyabuddhakṣetragamana);[he
thinks:] ‘Just as the four main elements (cāturmahābhautika) in the external
world nourish all living beings (satvaupajīvya), may the four main elements belonging
to me nourish all living beings!May there be in me no root of good connecting with the
efficiency in knowledge of the dharma that does not support all living beings (mā bhūt tan
mama kuśalamūlaṃ dharmajñānakauśalyam vā yan na sarvvasatvopajīvyaṃ syād)! Thus the roots
of good will be transformed by me.’Quotation from ŚikṣMS 22b3; B 33,11-12; ŚikṣTib(D) 24b1;
ŚikṣChi(T.1636) 82b5-7.ŚikṣMS: āryagaganagañjasūtre ’py āha mā bhūt tan mama kuśalamūlaṃ
dharmajñānakauśalyam vā yan na sarvvasatvopajīvyaṃ syād iti |ŚikṣTib: ’phags pa nam mkha’
mdzod kyi mdo las kyaṅ | bdag gi dge ba’i rtsa ba’am chos la mkhas pa gaṅ yin pa de sems

that way, the bodhisatva, having accumulated immeasurable
merits, nourishes all living beings.
