Bodhisatva Maitreya

Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Maitreya: “O Maitreya, I entrust
(parindāmi) you with this [teaching of] incomparable complete awakening, which has been established
for countless hundreds of millions of aeons, in order that it will be memorized,
understood, read, and elucidated in detail to others, in order to give thanks and gratitude
to the tathāgata, fulfill my aspirations (abhiprāya), increase and purify many beings’
roots of good (kuśalamūla), make the bodhisatvas attain the light of the dharma (dharmāloka),
subjugate all Māras, defeat all heretics (tīrthika), uphold the dharma of the highest
meaning (paramārthadharma), and in order not to break the continuity of the three jewels (triratnavaṃśānupaccheda).”At
these words, the bodhisatva Maitreya addressed himself to the
Lord: “O Lord, I will protect this unexcelled treasury of the Dharma Jewel (anuttaradharmaratnanidhāna)
for the sake of the complete extinction of the tathāgata (tathāgataparinirvāṇa).Why
is that? Because, Lord, this is the true dharma (saddharma) of myself and the Awakened
Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).O Lord, when I have
dwelled in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha), I have strived for protecting, upholding,
and keeping these sūtras for a long time.O Lord, in the latter time, in the latter age (paścimakāle
paścimasameye), if someone were to hear this true sūtra, grasp it, retain it,
recite it, fully explain it to others, and practice it himself, may you know that it is because
of the sustaining power of maitreya (maitreyādhiṣṭhāna).If, Lord, the partisans of the
Māra were to attack, even further, if the root of goods were to fill up every pore of my
whole body, and then if all living beings in the world system of three thousand worlds were
to become the wicked Māras, they do not approach even a hundredth part of the root of
goods in one of the pores and so on, until nor do they approach even the likeness of it (ekaromakūpasya
kuśalamūlaḥ śatatamīm api kalāṃ nopaiti yāvad upamām api nopaiti).O Lord, as
all regions of Māras (sarvamāramaṇḍala) were conquered by the power of my merits (puṇyabala)
and the power of my knowledge (jñānabala), this awakening will be protected by the tathāgata
for countless millions.”The Lord said: “Good, good, Maitreya, these four are the bodhisatva’s
actions. What four? 1) conquering all Māras and vices (sarvamārakleśanigraha);
2) defeating all opponents (sarvaparapravādin) in accordance with the dharma (dharmānulomikābhibhava);
3) bringing all beings to maturity (satvaparipācana); 4) upholding the true dharma
(saddharmaparigraha).Those four actions are belonging to one, namely, upholding the
true dharma (saddharmaparigraha).”
