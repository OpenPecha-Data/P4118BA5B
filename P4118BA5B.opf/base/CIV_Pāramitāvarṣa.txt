PāramitāvarṣaThen the bodhisatva Apāyajaha addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son
of good family, please pacify three evil existences (tryapāya).”Immediately after that,
a bright light shone from the open space (āntarīkṣa), and the inhabitants of hell (naraka),
animals (tairyagyonika), and the inhabitants of Yāma’s world (yamalaukika), all those
who were touched by the light were filled with happiness (sukha), and so all beings in the
three evil existences were pacified.Then, the rain of gifts, such as flowers (puṣpa), garlands
(mālā), incenses (gandha), unguents (upalepana), aromatic powers (cūrṇa), religious
robes (cīvara), parasols (chattra), banners (dhvaja), pennons (patākā), five kinds of musical
instruments (vādita), songs, male servants (dāsa), female servants (dāsī), wives (bhāryā),
boys (dāraka), girls (kanyā), female attendants (dāra), horses (aśva), elephants (hasti),
chariots (ratha), foot-soldiers (patti), vehicles (vāha), houses (gṛha), villages (sagrāma),
cities (nagara), towns (nigama), provinces (janapada), kingdoms (rāṣṭra), capitals
(rājadhāni), gardens (udyāna), pavilions (kūṭāgāra), palaces (prāsāda), portals (toraṇa),
windows (gavākṣa), half-moon shaped decorations on building (ardhacandra), thrones (mañca),
palanquin (śivika), and chariots drawn by four cattle, sixteen cattle, and a thousand of
good horses (aśvājāneya), poured down from the open space.Thus the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
sustained by the magical presence said to the whole congregation of bodhisatvas:“Sons of
good family, having received all these riches, give them all away, and fulfill the perfection
of generosity (dānapāramitā)!”Then the bodhisatva named Śīlālaṃkāra said this to the
bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son of good family, if the rain of the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā)
poured down by your magical power, why do you not pour down the rain of the perfection
of morality (śīlapāramitā)?”Immediately after his words, the buddhas and bodhisatvas
in ten directions praised the adornments of the virtues of morality (śīlaguṇālaṃkāra),
and the voice of praising the virtues of morality, as many expressions as there are, resonated
in the open space (āntarīkṣa).In the same way, the voices of [praising] the virtues
of tolerance, vigour, meditation, and insight (kṣāntivīryadhyānaprajñā) [resonated in the
open space.] As long as the buddhas and bodhisatvas in ten directions taught a hundred thousand
ways into the dharma (dharmamukha) by means of syllables, explanations, and agreed
terms (akṣaraniruktisaṃketa), all those voices of the dharma, which never increase or decrease
and do not enter into any difference, resonated in the open space endlessly.By the sound
of the dharma, all living beings in this world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu)
obtained this understanding,and thus immeasurable and incalculable
living beings became matured in the three vehicles (triyāna).
