20. DharmaprayogaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva collect all qualities of
the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmasamudānaya) by thorough practice (yoniśaḥprayoga)?‘Thorough (yoniśaḥ)’
means the entrance into dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśa). Why is
that?As is the cause and conditions (hetupratyaya), thus the fruit (phala) is produced (abhinirvṛtta).The
generosity (dāna) is the cause of great comforts (mahābhogahetu),and the
bodhisatva, having transferred that giving into omniscience (tyāgaṃ sarvajñatāyaṃ pariṇāmaitvā),
fulfils the perfection of giving (dānapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The morality (śīla) is
the cause of birth among gods and men (devamānuṣajātihetu),and the bodhisatva, being born
among gods and men, makes living beings adopt moral ways (śīlam avatārayati);he, having
transferred the maintaining morality into omniscience, fulfils the perfection of morality
(śīlapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The tolerance and mildness (kṣāntisauratya) are the causes which
are the ornaments of body, speech and thought (kāyavākcittālaṃkārahetu);the bodhisatva
practices what is good for oneself and for others (ātmaparahita) through the ornaments of
body, speech and thought (kāyavākcittālaṃkāra);he, having transferred the basis of wishing
to help and tolerance into omniscience (hitakāmakṣāntyavasthāṃ sarvajñatāyaṃ pariṇāmaitvā),
fulfils the perfection of tolerance (kṣāntipāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The vigour (vīrya)
is the cause of collecting all Buddha learning (sarvabuddhaśruta);The bodhisatva makes an
effort (vīryam ārambya), attains all roots of good (kuśalamūlaṃ samādāpya), transfers the
vigour of attaining all roots of good into omniscience, and fulfils the perfection of vigour
(vīryapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The meditation (dhyāna) is the cause of happiness and noble
birth (pramuditacittājāneyahetu);the bodhisatva completes the accumulations for peaceful
meditation (śamathasaṃbhāra) with happiness and noble birth (pramuditacittājāneya);he, having
transferred the accumulations of peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāra) into omniscience,
fulfils the perfection of meditation (dhyānapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).Learning (śruta)
is the cause of great insight (mahāprājñahetu);the bodhisatva, not being entangled in the
preconceived viewpoints (upalaṃbhadṛṣṭikāgrahaṇa), having transferred the learning without
apprehending (anupalambhaśruta) into omniscience, fulfils the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitāṃ
paripūrayati).In the same way with all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharma), whatever
the cause of good qualities (kuśaladharmahetu) accumulated, its effect (phala) will
appear without effort (anābhoga).Further, the cause and conditions (hetupratyaya) are called
thorough mental effort (yoniśomanasikāra).With regard to what is called ‘thorough (yoniśaḥ)’,
there is the self in every fundamental moment of existence.Just as there is no self
in oneself, so there is no self in any moment of existence.Just as the self is empty (śūnya),
so all moments of existence are empty.Just as the self is merely a word (nāma), so all
moments of existence are merely words.Thus the thorough practice (yoniśaḥprayoga) of the
bodhisatva is to be equally associated with all moments of existence.That which is the same
as all moments of existence (sarvadharmasamatā) is the same as all qualities of the Buddha
(sarvabuddhadharmasamatā), and thus the thorough practice of the bodhisatva is to attain
the qualities of the Buddha (buddhadharma).
