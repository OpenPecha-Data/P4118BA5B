Brahmā Sahāṃpati

Then the Lord said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Then, son of good family, I will invoke the
Brahmā, the lord of Sahā (brahmā sahāṃpati), and because of that he will continue protecting
this exposition of religion. The words of invoking is as follows:tadyathā | maitre |
śubhamaitre | dharmamaitre | maitryānusahite samaitre | sandhimaitre | anugamamaitre | anugacchamaitre
| anuttāramaitre | sātramaitre | dharmamaitre | anugrahamaitre | apratisārimaitre

|Those treasuries of open space are the words of invoking the Brahā,
the lord of Sahā.”Then the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, dwelling in the heaven of Brahmā (brahmaloka),
became aware of the presence of the buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna), heard these words
of friendly mantra (maitrīmantra) by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva), namely the
sphere of divine hearing (divyaśrotradhātu), together with sixty-eight hundred thousand
Brahmās, approached to the Lord, prostrated himself at the Lord’s feet, and sat down on a
side.Having sat down on a side, the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, addressed himself to the Lord:
“O Lord, since we are sustained by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhita),
we will be endowed with friendliness and compassion (maitrīkaruṇā) and strive for
this exposition of religion.As for the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka), who, having collected
this teaching of the buddha, understand it, retain it, read it, teach it, and make it
into a book (pustaka), wherever they hold religious discourses (dharmakathā) in the wilderness
(araṇya), forest (utpathamārga), village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama), kingdom
(rāṣṭra) or capital (rājadhāni), if they explain this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya)
in detail, then we will protect them, shield them, guard them, rejoice them, fulfill
energy (bala), attain recollection (smṛti), acquire intelligence (mati), be accordance
with realization (prativedha), fulfill eloquence (pratibhāna), inspire the unbelieving with
faith, and liberate those who have faith. According to the tathāgata’s guiding principle
of the dharma (tathāgatadharmanaya), Lord, we will uphold and disseminate it”At these words,
the Lord said this to the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā: “Excellent, excellent, Brahmā, since
you uphold the true dharma, the tathāgata rejoices in you.Just as I am turning the wheel
of the dharma (dharmacakra), just so, Brahmā, you also will before long turn it.Just as
you are upholding my true dharma, just so other Brahmās will uphold your true dharma.”
