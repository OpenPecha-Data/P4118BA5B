Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda

Then the Lord said this to the elder Mahākāśyapa and the venerable Ānanda: “Mahākāśyapa and
Ānanda, I entrust (parindāmi) you with this [teaching of] incomparable complete awakening
so that it will be memorized, understood, read and elucidated to others.”The Mahākāśyapa said:
“O Lord, we will uphold this awakening of the tathāgata with all my might.”The Ānanda
said: “O Lord, we will take up this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) and disseminate
it by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhāna).”
