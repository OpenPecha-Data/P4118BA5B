9. BuddhānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of the Buddha, which is authorized
by the Lord for bodhisatvas? (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā
buddhānusmṛtiḥ).a) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of morality (śīla),
he never gives up (asaṃpramoṣata) unsullied morality (anāsravaśīla);b) while recollecting
the Buddha in the perspective concentration (samādhi), he is changeless (nirvikāra) concerning
the sphere of the moments of existence (dharmadhātu) being always same;c) while recollecting
the Buddha from the perspective of insight (prajñā), he is free from thought-constructions
(nirvikalpa) since there is no activity in all moments of existence (sarvadharmāpracāra);d)
while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of liberation (vimukti), he
does not stay in the secondary-thought (dvitīyacitta);e) while recollection the Buddha from
the perspective of the vision of the knowledge of liberation (vimuktijñānadarśana), he
is not attached (asakta) to any knowledge (sarvajñāna);f) while recollecting the Buddha from
the perspective of power (bala), he is not moving (āniñjya) concerning the knowledge which
is equanimous in all three times (tryadhvasamata);g) while recollecting the Buddha from
the perspective of fearlessness (vaiśāradya), he does not stay with any defilement (sarvāsravaḥ
sārdhaṃ na saṃvasati);h) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of all
qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma), he does not have any false discrimination in
the sameness of the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātusamatāṃ na vikalpayati).Furthermore,
the recollection of the Buddha is not to see (na samanupaśyati) the Lord from
his material body (rūpasvabhāva), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection
through understanding the nature of the material form;it is not to see the Lord from
his feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna),
but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection through understanding their nature;it
is not to see the Lord from his parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception
(skandhadhātvāyatana), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection through
understanding their nature.Again, since he understands the essence of all moments of
existence (sarvadharmasvabhāvajñānena), the recollection of the great insight (mahāprajñānusmṛti)
is beyond any mental effort (sarvamanasikāra) and the arising (paryuttāna) of any
viewpoint (sarvadṛṣṭi);Since in this way recollection is pure (anāvila), the knowledge of
the application of awareness (smṛtyupsthānajñāna) is called the recollection of the Buddha
which is taught by the Lord.Further, the recollection of the Buddha is not to be attached
to any of the Lord’s ways of behavior (sarveryapatha), to wit: standing (sthita), walking
(caṃkrama), sitting (niṣadya), sleeping (śayana), going (gati), coming (āgati), speaking
(pravyāhāra), and not speaking (apravyāhāra).Since there is no attachment, he does not recollect
recollection nor recollect non-recollection.Since there is no mental effort in recollection
(asmṛtimanasikāra), he does not recollect the Buddha in the perspective of form,
distinguishing marks or any state of things (rūpalakṣaṇadharmatā).There is no involvement
with any distinguishing mark or object (sarvanimittālambanāsamudācāra), son of good family,
this is therefore the recollection of the Buddha, which is authorized by the Lord.
