The great vehicle (mahāyāna) is made with four wheels (cakra), namely with the means of attraction
(saṃgrahavastu),the spokes (ara) are well fitted as the roots of good (kuśalamūla)
have been transformed (pariṇāmita) with intention (āśaya),it is well made with a deep nave
(gambhīranābhi) as there is the immense knowledge of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādajñāna),it
is well kept together by the axle (akṣa) in order to bear the burdens of all
living beings (sarvasatvabhāra),the pole (īṣā) is firmly fixed since it is supported by the
great friendliness and great compassion (mahāmaitrīmahākaruṇa),it is surrounded with the
railing (vedikā) of all sorts of jewels as it is adorned with all the jewels of dharma (sarvadharmaratnasamalaṃkṛta),it
is fastened with a strong girth (varatra) of the highest intention
(adhyāśaya) since it surpasses one’s earlier promise (pūrvapratijñottaraka),it is
carried on by a yoke (yugaṃdharavāhi) yoked with the team of insight and expedient means
(prajñopāyayuganaddha),it is fastened in the holes of peaceful meditation and expanded vision
(śamathavipaśyanā),it is powered by the power of understanding four holy truths (catuḥsatyaparijñābala),it
has the power of a thousand well-bred horses (ājanya),it goes to all
buddha-fields (sarvabuddhakṣetra) by four magical feet (ṛddhipāda),the horns (śṛṅga) of recollection
are bound with the string of a jewel necklace (ratnamālā),it roams widely and broadly
since it contains all living beings,it fulfills its function (sukṛtakarma) as it subdues
enemies (pratyarthika) and the Māras (mārapratyarthika),it is applied with (prayukta)
practical knowledge and wisdom (vidyājñāna),it is driven by an autopilot (adhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhita),all
buddhas in ten directions think of it,it is well adorned with a lion’s throne (siṃhāsana_samalaṃkṛta),is
praised by all the gods, the king of the gods, and the highest god
(sarvadevaśakrabrahmābhinandita),has good visual form that one never be satisfied with
looking at (atṛptadarśana),is beautiful to behold (darśanīya),is unbreakable because it is
firm as a diamond (vajradṛḍha),is unchangeable due to the promise (pratijñā) based on the
firmness of the highest intention (sārādhyāśaya),is controlled and well-grasped by a charioteer
(sārathi),is always led by the thought of awakening (bodhicittapūrvaṃgama),runs smoothly
as it is attuned to the fulfilling of the qualities of vows (praṇidhānaguṇaparipūrṇānugata),obtains
the light (ālokalabdha) of divine sight in the great view of ten directions
(daśadigvilokitadivyacakṣur),has the pure and wide light of infinite rays (raśmi) so that
it can illuminate the ten directions,is always filled with flowers because the rain of flowers
(puṣpavarṣa), namely the limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), continually pours down,is
equipped with musical instruments which always produce the sound of dharma (dharmasvara),is
in accordance with the mental capacity of followers,strives for all practices of bodhisatva
(sarvabodhisatvacaryāparyeṣṭi),is superior because of infinite knowledge and immeasurable
virtue (anantajñānaākāraguṇa),and is connected with the knowledge of knowing everything
that is emptiness endowed with all sorts of excellencies (sarvākāravaropetaśūnyatāsarvajñajñānasamprayukta).
Son of good family, the great vehicle (mahāyāna) is like that.Therefore,
Good men (satpuruṣa), since the bodhisatva enters on the supramundane way (lokottaramārga)
after having put on the armour, he appears to many beings, performing the deeds of the
Buddha (buddhakārya), even without obtaining omniscience (sarvajñāna).”When this arrangement
of way, armour, and vehicle was displayed, seventy-two thousand gods and human beings
produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening (iha mārgasaṃnāhayānavyūhe nirdiśyamāne
dvisaptatīnāṃ prāṇidevamānuṣaṇām anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni),and
thirty-two thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance that all things are unborn by
purifying the supramundane way (dvātriṃśatīnāṃ ca bodhisatvasahasrāṇām lokottaramārgapariśuddhyā
anutpattikadharmakṣāntiḥ pratilabdhā).

Ratnaśrī

gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 6Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī addressed himself to the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, was the supramunane way purified by you?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, it was purified by purifying myself.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good
family, how did you purify yourself?”Gaganagañja said: “Since this world is pure, son of
good family, I am originally pure.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is the purity
of the world?”Gaganagañja said: “Since the form (rūpa) is originally pure, it is deathless
(acyuta).Since the form in the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the form
in the present is pure, it is established in the true state (dharmatāsthita).In the same
way, since the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are originally pure, those are deathless.Since the consciousness (vijñāna) in
the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the consciousness in the present is pure,
it is established in the true state (dharmatā). Son of good family, this is the purity
of the world.”Ratnaśrī said: “As for the pure world, where can we see it?”Gaganagañja said:
“Son of good family, you can see such pure world in all dharmas.”Ratnaśrī said: “How can
we see all the dharmas?"Gaganagañja said: “It is when we know how to distinguish the past
and future of all dharmas by means of insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna)”Ratnaśrī said:
“How do you distinguish the past and future of all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there
is no cessation (pariccheda) or eternity (śāśvata).”Ratnaśrī said: “Where is no cessation
or eternity?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there is no cessation or eternity there is no origination
or extinction (anutpannāniruddhatā).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this place without origination
or extinction?”Gaganagañja said: “It cannot be verbally expressed.”Ratnaśrī said:
“Why is that?”Gaganagañja said: “Because the dharma is incalculable and ineffable.”Ratnaśrī:
“Son of good family, how can you count the incalculable dharmas (asaṃkhyeyadharma)?”Gaganagañja
said: “Just as, even though on the earth it is possible to measure open space,
in open space it is impossible, just so, even though it is possible to measure by means of
calculation (gaṇanamukhena), it is still impossible to measure by means of calculation. This
is because the nature of the means of calculation is non-calculation.”Ratnaśrī said: “What
then are the means of calculation and the means without calculation?”Gaganagañja said:
“The means of calculation is conditioned (saṃskṛta), and the means without calculation is
unconditioned (asaṃskṛta).Therefore, that which is without calculation in the unconditioned
is beyond calculation, and that which is beyond calculation is unconditioned, thus the
Lord said that by means of insight one should calculate, investigate, and give up what is
to be given up.Accordingly, when the bodhisatva calculates the dharma in the conditioned,
measures it in his consciousness, and reflects on it in the right way, he never sees any
dharma which is to be fully known (parijñeya), to be eliminated (prahātavya), to be realized
(sākṣātkartavya), or to be cultivated (bhāvayitavya).Since the bodhisatva never sees any
dharma, he does not establish any dharma.Where he does not establish any dharma, there is
the attainment of the absence of basis (anālaya).Where he attains the absence of basis,
there is not anything to be wanted.Where there is nothing to be wanted, there is nothing to
be obtained.Since he is free from mental conception (upalambha), there is nothing related
to the self (amama) or nothing to be grasped (aparigraha).What is non-grasping? It is not
grasping permanence or impermanence in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative
factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna);it is not grasping suffering or happiness
in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness; it
is not grasping the self or selflessness in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative
factors or consciousness;it is not grasping the beautiful or the ugly in from, as well
as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or] consciousness; it is not grasping emptiness
or non-emptiness in from, as well as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or]
consciousness.Even though he does not grasp anything, he attains concentration (samādhi).
He stays within existence (saṃsāra), but he never grasps any vice of existence.Even though
he makes living beings believe in extinction, he attained extinction from the beginning
(ādiparinirvṛta).What then is the extinction of the bodhisatva?Extinction (parinirvāṇa) is
the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta).Even though the bodhisatva never makes even a small bad
action (akuśalakarman), he still enters into grasping for the good actions (kuśaladharma).Since
the bodhisatva makes all composite things (sarvasaṃskṛta) as belonging to body, speech,
and mind (kāyavākcitta), he, having investigated them, transforms them into omniscience.He
does not seek omniscience as form nor feeling, nor perception, nor formative factors,
nor consciousness.Because he is not attached to his thoughts and morality, while fulfilling
all his vows (sarvapraṇidhāna), he never sees (na samanupaśyati) the dharma in which
there is increase or decrease.Since the dharma does not decrease nor increase, the bodhisatva,
having attained the sameness of all dharmas (sarvadharmasamatā), performs the practice
of a bodhisatva, being established in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu), thus he neither
performs nor practices any dharma.Son of good family, the bodhisatva who has attained such
extinction performs the practice of the bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā).Why is that? When
the bodhisatva is established in the unconditioned (abhisaṃskāra) among all constructed,
he attains extinction, and therefore the bodhisatva does not construct things among all the
constructed things. Thus the unconditioned is called ‘extinction (parinirvāṇa)’ because
it is not conditioned.Since the other shore (pāra) is that which does not enter into consciousness
(vijñāna), the bodhisatva is characterized (prabhāvita) as having no conceptual activity
(avijñapti), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is without distinguishing
marks (animitta), the bodhisatva does not transform his thoughts into distinguishing
marks, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is beyond false imagination
(parikalpa), his thoughts do not enter into the imagination, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since
the other shore is baseless, he does not transform his thoughts into the absence
of basis (anālaya), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Therefore, son of good family, this is
the extinction of the bodhisatva, namely performing the practice of the bodhisatva.Then
the Lord applauded the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjāya
bodhisatvāya mahāsatvāya sādhukāram adāt): “Well done, good man, well done (sādhu
sādhu satpuruṣa). If it should be explained, I will say like that.”When this teaching was
declared, five hundred bodhisatvas produced the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)].Then
the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja addressed himself
to the Lord: “O Lord, we attained eloquence by this light of the dharma from the tathāgata
(tathāgatadharmāloka).Just as forms appear in dependence on light, so we attained shining
eloquence by the power generated by the tathāgata.”Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī said this
to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, why do you hide your knowledge and teach
that you attained eloquence by the presence of the Buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna)?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, all the eloquence of the bodhisatvas, even a small part of it,
should be seen as the presence of the Buddha. Why is that? If the buddhas do not make those
dharmas appear, how could the bodhisatva attain eloquence?”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good
family, how is the eloquence transferred?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, there is
no transference [of eloquence,] but, nevertheless, the eloquence is attained by the eloquence
of the Buddha.”Just as, even though ignorance (avidyā) is not transferred to the formative
factors (saṃskāra), the formative factors are produced by the cause of ignorance, just
so, even though the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere, by its cause
the eloquence still arises.Just as the sounds of horses, elephants, and human beings (hayagajamanuṣyakāḥ
śabdāḥ) are not transferred to an echo (pratiśrutkā) but because of it the
echo (pratiśrutkā) arises, just so the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere
but by its cause the eloquence still arises.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, dependent
origination (pratītyasamutpāda) is profound (gambhīra).”Gaganagañja said: “In the same way
any dharma is never born.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is it that there is
no dependent origination of any dharma?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, if a certain
agent (kartṛ) is in conditions, the dharmas will be born, but, because any agent is not
apprehended in conditions, the agent is not apprehended in any dharma.Ratnaśrī said: “Son
of good family, what is it that the Tathāgata never appears?”Gaganagañja said: “if suchness
arises, the tathāgata will appear, but still we hold the view that suchness never arises.
Why is that? Suchness is brought about (prabhāvita) through non-arising. One who understands
all dharmas just like the suchness, he is called the tathāgata.Ratnaśrī said: “Son of
good family, why did the tathāgata come?”Gaganagañja said: “Something like that should be
let alone (sthāpanīya).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this letting alone?”Gaganagañja said: “Because
the absolute truth (dharmadhātu) is in accordance with its proper place (yathāsthāna).”Ratnaśrī
said: “What is the place of the absolute truth?”Gaganagañja said: “It is not the
place of birth nor the place of death, it is neither a place nor non-place. Such a place
is the place of the absolute truth, and just the place of absolute truth is the place of
all dharmas.The place of all dharmas is not a place, and that which is not a place is without
place because there is no place of birth or place of death, thus it is neither a place
nor non-place. Such is the place of the tathāgata which is not considered as the place of
birth nor the place of cessation.In this way, son of good family, that the tathāgata appears
is an extreme (eko ’ntaḥ) and that the tathāgata never appears is another extreme, thus
you should seek the tathāgata from the middle way (madhyamapratipad) which is free from
both extremes, namely the existence of birth or the non-existence of birth.”Ratnaśrī said:
“Son of good family, although that the buddha arises from the absence of the place of birth
or death is profound, son of good family, who would believe this appearing of the buddha?”Gaganagañja
said: “One who does not make any matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa).”Ratnaśrī
said: “Son of good family, how is ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ explained?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ is a word for imputing (samāropa).One
who does not impute anything to any dharma does not makes any matter of dispute concerning
any dharma, therefore a word for ‘no matter of dispute’ is a word for sameness (samatā);a
word for sameness is a word for the incomparable (asadṛśa);a word for the incomparable
is a word for the absence of words (apada);a word for the absence of words is a word
for the absence of letters (anakṣara);a word for the absence of letters is a word for the
absence of information (avijñapti);a word for the absence of information, in which there
is no activity (apracāra) of thoughts and mind (cittamanas), is a word for the absence of
activity;Just as, even though bird-tracks do not remain in the sky, we still talk about it
with the place of sound, in the same way, whether the buddha is born or unborn, we still
talk about it with the word to be born.In that case, even though the bodhisatva teaches non-origination
(anutpāda), he still makes things appear.Why is that? Because the essential
nature of all dharmas (sarvadharmasvabhāva) is the essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasavabhāva);the
essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasvabhāva) is without own nature (niḥsvabhāva);that
which has no essential nature, in that there is no existence;that in which
there is no existence, that is established nowhere, thus all dharmas are the limit established
nowhere (apratiṣṭhitakoṭi);the limit established nowhere is the limit of all dharmas,
thus all the dharmas are called ‘being established in the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi)’;what
is called the limit of reality is the unlimited limit (aparicchinnakoṭi);since the limit
is in accordance with all limits, all dharmas appear as having attained the limit.Why
is that? Because, even if the limit attains another part of the sky, it is still the same
limit in the sky. Just as there is no border dividing the sky, just so there is no limit
of any dharma (sarvadharmakoṭi) in the limit of reality (bhutakoṭi).Since the limit of reality
is the limit of the self (ātmakoṭi), by knowing the limit of the self, the knowledge
of the limit of all beings is understood.Since the limit of all dharmas is unified with the
limit of all beings, all dharmas are called ‘the limit of exhaustion (kṣaya), the end of
exhaustion, and the ultimate of exhaustion.’What is called ‘exhaustion (kṣaya)’ is a designation
(adhivacana) for extinction (nirvāṇa), and thus all dharmas are the same as extinction.Why
is that? Because it is without adversary (niṣpratipakṣa).Just as there is no adversary
in open space, so there is no adversary in all dharmas.Those who seek extinction (nirvāṇa)
in the perspective of an adversary see birth and death, and those who think that these
dharmas will be born and will die never know the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā)
since they practice in birth and death.Therefore, the Lord said “You should know! you should
know! Do not dispute! Do not dispute! Fulfill the indisputable excellent qualities of
ascetics (śrāmaṇa)!”

Ānanda

At that time, the venerable Ānanda addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu āyuṣman ānando
bhagavantam etad avocat):“It is a marvelous thing, Lord, just as the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
manifests his body, just so he teaches us.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda,
my body is manifested though, it is not manifested by myself.Why is that? Because open
space is my body, it is manifested.”Ānanda said: “How then is your body manifested?”Gaganagañja
said: “This is because, even though the buddha’s work (buddhakṛtya) is done by the
body, the true body (dharmakāya), which is not undefiled, is not brought about through
the parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana), nor born
of the inverted body (viparyayakāya), but obtained by the mental body (manaskāya). In this
way, the bodhisatva’s body is manifested.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, are you manifesting
all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda, one should not think of my body separated
from the dharma, it is the dharma itself, and the dharma itself is my body, in this
way I manifest my body.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, if you manifested your body,
are you an Arhat?”Gaganagañja said: “Having penetrated the entrance into the dharma which
is free from impurity (araṇādharmamukhaprativedha), without desire (rāga), I do not have any
aversion or bewilderment (dveṣamoha), thus I am an Arhat.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family,
if you are a Worthy One, when did you reach complete extinction (parinirvāṇa)?”Gaganagañja
said: “Venerable Ānanda, an Arhat does not reach extinction, and ordinary people (pṛthagjanā)
are not Arhats who reach extinction.Why is that? Because an Arhat gives up the concept
of extinction (nirvāṇasaṃjñā).Since ordinary people just produce the thought-constructions
of extinction, to the extent that they made thought-constructions do they reach extinction.”Ānanda
said: “According to our interpretation of what you said, son of good family,
you are not an Arhat, ordinary man (pṛthagjana), one who is undergoing training (śaikṣa),
one who no longer needs training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tathāgata.”Gaganagañja
said: “Good, Ānanda, very good. Even though the bodhisatva, who is not an Arhat,
ordinary man (pṛthagjana), one who is undergoing training (śaikṣa), one who no longer needs
training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tathāgata, teaches every stage (sarvabhūmi),
he is still not established in any place.”When this teaching was declared, in order
to protect the dharma, five hundred disciples, immediately offering dharma-robes to the
bodhisatva Gaganagañja, said: “May all living beings attain eloquence such as this (sarvasatvā
īdṛśasya pratibhānasya lābhino bhavantu)!”Then, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja, the dharma-robes disappeared into open space.Then those monks, the Worthy
Ones, said: “Son of good family, where did the dharma-robes go?”Gaganagañja said: “They
went into the treasury of open space.”Then the Lord smiled (atha khalu bhagavān smitaṃ
prādurakarot), and the venerable Ānanda asked the meaning of smiling: “O Lord, as the tathāgata
does not smile for no reason, what is the reason for smiling?”The Lord said: “Ānanda,
the bodhisatva Gaganagañja received five hundred robes by those five hundred monks, put
them into the treasury of open space, sprinkled on the world-sphere called Kāṣāyadhvaja. In
this way he performed the buddha-activities (buddhakārya) in the buddha-field of the tathāgata
Parvatarāja. Then the religious discourses given by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja arose
from those dharma-robes in the buddha-field, and hundreds koṭis of bodhisatvas attained
the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)] by the teaching of the
dharma.Ānanda, you should see the sphere of supernatural power and knowledge (ṛddhijñānaviṣaya)
of the bodhisatva in order to bring various living beings to maturity (anekaparyāyasatvaparipācana).When
this teaching was taught, the great rain of flowers, which have been
never seen before, shining brilliantly like the radiant sun and moon (candrasūrya), poured
down, and a voice resonated from those flowers: “Having heard this teaching of the bodhisatva
Gaganagñja, those living beings with faith, being sealed with the irreversible seal
(avaivartikamudrā), will be devoted themselves to the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa).”Ānanda
said: “O Lord, where are these flowers coming from?”The Lord said: “Ānanda, the Brahmā
Prabhāvyūha, who reigned over one hundred thousand world-spheres, sprinkled these flowers
in order to worship (pūjākarmaṇa) the bodhisatva Gaganagañja.”Ānanda said: “O Lord, we would
like to see him.”The Lord said: “Just wait a minute, Ānanda, you will see him soon.”

Prabhāvyūha

At that time, the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha, being surrounded and followed (parivṛta) by sixty-eight
hundred thousand Brahmās, teleported from the world of Brahmā to the presence of the Lord
(brahmaloke antarhitaḥ bhagavato ’ntike prātiṣṭhata), bowed down at his feet (bhagavataḥ
pādau śirobhir vanditvā), circumambulated him three times (tripradakṣiṇīkṛṭya), and sat down
on a side.Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, the greatness
(māhātmya) of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s morality, concentration, supernormal knowledge,
knowledge, insight, fulfilling vows, skillful means, highest intention, mastery of
the dharma, ornaments for body, speech and thought, and mastery over all dharmas (śīlasamādhyabhijñājñānaprajñāpraṇidhānaparipūraṇopāyakauśalādhyāśayadharmeśvarakāyavākcittālaṃkārasarvadharmavaśitā)
are marvelous (āścarya)!Since the bodhisatva Gaganagañja has purified his
former activities, he manifests all activities by body, speech, and thought without any
effort. O Lord, since his former roots of good (pūrvakuśalamūla) have been not yet repaid
by anyone, that the bodhisatva Gaganagañja roars this lion’s roar (siṃhanādanādi) in the
present time is the outcome of the profound practice in the past.”The Lord said: “Quite so,
it is just as you have said. The incomparable complete awakening of the bodhisatvas arises
from the former roots of good, merits, and knowledges (pūrvakuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then
the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the root of good of the bodhisatvas,
what is the merit, what is the knowledge?”The Lord said: “Brahmā, ‘the root of
good (kuśalamūla)’ is the initial resolution to strive for awakening (prathamacittotpādika),
and the root of all qualities of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmamūla);‘merit (puṇya)’ is,
as soon as the thought of awakening is produced, to conquer all items of meritorious action
consisting in generosity, morality, and meditational self-cultivation of all disciples
and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhānāṃ dānamayaṃ śīlamayaṃ bhāvanāmayaṃ sarvapunyakriyāvastvabhibhāvana);‘knowledge
(jñāna)’ is to accumulate the root of good, and to
transform the accumulations into omniscience (sarvākārajñatā).Further, ‘the root of good’
is pure intention (śuddhāśaya) since it is without deception or guile (māyāśāṭhya), ‘merit’
is the practice (prayoga) for all merits, etc., and ‘knowledge’ is the highest intention
(adhyāśaya) of going to a different state (viśeṣagamana).Further, ‘the root of good’ is the
solemn vow of good teachings (kuśaladharma), ‘merit’ is never being content (asaṃtuṣṭi)
with the accumulation of the roots of good, and ‘knowledge’ is to consider the roots of good
as an illusion.Further, ‘the root of good’ is to have spiritual friends (kalyāṇamitra),
‘merit’ is not abandoning spiritual friends (kalyāṇamitrāparityāga), and ‘knowledge’ is
asking questions to spiritual friends.Further, ‘the root of good’ is aiming at the dharma
(dharmārthika), ‘merit’ is striving for the dharma (dharmakāma), and ‘knowledge’ is taking
pleasure in the delights of the dharma (dharmārāmaratirata).Further, ‘the root of good’ is
seeking the dharma (dharmaparyeṣṭi), ‘merit’ is teaching the dharma without a view to profit
(nirāmiṣadharmadeśaka), and ‘knowledge’ is without secrecy of teachers concerning religion
(dharme ’nācāryamuṣṭi).Further, ‘the root of good’ is listening to the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa),
‘merit’ is thorough reflection (yoniśaḥpratisaṃkhyāna), and ‘knowledge’ is accomplishing
the dharma (dharmanirhāra).Further, ‘the root of good’ is seeing the buddha (buddhadarśana),
‘merit’ is worshiping the buddha, and ‘knowledge’ is relying on the buddha.Further,
‘the root of merit’ is to become a renunciant, ‘merit’ is to be pleased with the [fourfold]
sources of holiness (āryavaṃśa), and ‘knowledge’ is to be pleased in hermits (araṇyavāsa).Further,
‘the root of good’ is being easily satisfied with food (subharasupoṣatā),
‘merit’ is effortlessly obtaining dhrama-robes and alms-bowls (cīvarapiṇḍapāta), and ‘knowledge’
is to usufruct (paribhoga) them without desire or greed.Further, ‘the root of good’
is to practice the presences of recollection (smṛtyupasthāna), ‘merit’ is fulfilling the
correct eliminations (samyakprahāṇaparipūraṇa), ‘knowledge’ is attaining the bases of magical
power (ṛddhipāda).Further, ‘the root of good’ is the entrance into the ability of faith
(śraddhendriya), ‘merit’ is in accordance with vigour, recollection, and awareness (vīrya_smṛtisaṃprajanya),
and ‘knowledge’ is the cultivation of concentration and insight (samādhiprajñā).Further,
‘the root of good’ is to be established in the five powers (pañcabala),
‘merit’ is to understand the limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), and ‘knowledge’ is to know
the entrance into the path (pathapraveśajñāna).Further, ‘the root of good’ is the happiness
in mind (pramuditacitta), ‘merit’ is seeking for peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāraparyeṣṭi),
and ‘knowledge’ is the skillfulness in the expanded vision (vipaśyanakauśalya).Further,

‘merit’ is to be patient with unpleasant words, and ‘knowledge’ is to abandon
his body and life in order to bring all being to maturity, and to transform it into

‘merit’ is the eagerness for all roots of good (sarvakuśalamūlacchanda), and ‘knowledge’
is to enter into the sameness in the absence of distinguishing mark (animittasamapraveśa),

equal to all living beings (sarvasatvasamacitta), ‘merit’ is to meditate on friendly thoughts

‘the root of good’ belongs to the bodhisatvas who have generated the initial determination

is to subdue all Māras, and ‘knowledge’ is to attain the incomparable perfect awakening
(bodhim abhisaṃbudh-) through insight that is associated with a moment of thought (ekacittakṣaṇasamāyuktaprajñā).In
this way, Brahmā, the bodhisatva arises from the root of good,
merit, and knowledge (kuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the
Lord: “It is a marvelous, Lord, that the tathāgata explains all sorts of qualities of the
buddha (sarvabuddhadharmanānātva) by means of these three root words [or stages] (mūlapada).”At
these words, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said to the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha: “Brahmā,
everything is included in a single word (ekapadasamavasṛta).Why is that? The word ‘emptiness
(śūnyatā)’ is a single word, and everything is included in emptiness;the word ‘signlessness
(ānimitta)’ is a single word, and everything is included in signlessness;the word ‘wishlessness
(apraṇihita)’ is a single word, and everything is included in wishlessness;in the
same manner, the words ‘the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskāra), non-desire (virāga), peace
(śānti), non-basis (anālaya), the absolute truth (dharmadhātu), suchness (tathatā), the limit
of reality (bhūtakoṭi), inexistence (asaṃbhava), and unbornness (anutpāda), each of them
is a single word, [and everything is included in them];the word ‘extinction (nirvāṇa)’
is a single word, and everything is included in extinction.Further, Brahmā, desire (rāga)
is a word for non-desire. Why? Because desire is the essence of non-desire (virāgasvabhāva).
Thus everything is included in the essence of desire (rāgasvabhāva).Aversion (dveṣa) is
a word for non-aversion (adveṣa). Why? Because aversion is the essence of non- aversion (aveṣasvabhāva).
Thus everything is the essence of aversion.Bewilderment (moha) is a word for
non-bewilderment (amoha). Why? Because bewilderment is the essence of non-bewilderment
(amohasvabhāva). Thus everything is the essence of bewilderment.Aggregation of perishable
things (satkāya) is a word for no aggregation of perishable things. Why? Because aggregation
of perishable things is the essence of no aggregation of perishable things. Thus everything
is the essence of aggregation of perishable things.Form (rūpa) is a word for the absence
of form. Why? Because form is the essence of absence of form. Thus everything is the essence
of form.In the same way, feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are words for the absence of feeling, perception, formative factors
or consciousness. Why? Because feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness
are the essence of absence of them. Thus everything is the essence of feeling, perception,
formative factors and consciousness.It is the same for fields, sense perceptions (dhātvāyatana),
and the twelve links of dependent origination (dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).Ignorance
(avidyā) is a word for the absence of ignorance. Why? Because ignorance is the essence
of the absence of ignorance, all dharmas of the buddha are the essence of ignorance.Birth
is a word for no birth (anutpāda). Why? Because birth is the essence of no birth, all
dharmas of the buddha are the essence of birth.All teachings of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharma)
is a word for no teaching (adharma). Why? Because everything is the essence of no
thought-construction (avikalpa), all teachings of the buddha are the essence of all teachings.Brahmā,
those are the door of entering into a word for dharma called (dharmapada) ‘the
entrance into the word without word (apadapadapraveśa)’ in which all dharmas of the buddha
are included in one single word.Just as, Brahmā, all streams flow into the great ocean (mahāsāgara),
just so all qualities of the buddha are included in a single word ‘the entrance
into the dharma (dharmamukha).’Just as, Brahmā, all manifestations of forms (sarvarūpāvabhāsa)
appear in open space, just so all teachings of the buddha are included in a single
word, thus this word is the inexhaustible word and the word which is split into one hundred
thousand.Just as, Brahmā, even though all of one hundred thousand are included in a single
word which is split into one hundred thousand, and even though those have been removed
after having been split for a thousand years, the muchness of one hundred thousand is neither
established in the connection with that word nor connected to ‘one hundred thousand,’
just so, Brahmā, while calculating and measuring to split the qualities of the buddha for
many hundreds of thousands of aeons, the qualities of the buddha are never experienced by
body or thought, thus those are impossible to be explained and too much to be explained.Further,
muchness is non-muchness. Why is that? If someone obtained so much or not so much,
it would be just as much as he obtained because there is no muchness or non-muchness. Thus
it is impossible to say that it is much or not much.Brahmā, calculating the dharmas of the
buddha is calculating all dharmas. Why is that? Because all dharmas are the dharmas of
the buddha, and the dharmas of the buddha are neither the dharmas nor non-dharmas.Why is that?
The dharmas of the buddha cannot be mentally constructed (parikalpita) by perception
(saṃjñā), or rather, those are taught in order to fully know the perception. Thus the thought-construction
(parikalpa) that there is neither perception nor non-perception is neither
the dharma nor the non-dharma.Brahmā, since the dharmas of the buddha have such an essential
character (lakṣaṇa), by their own essential character, they are pure and transcendent
(svalakṣaṇapariśuddhasvalakṣaṇavivikta).Since own essential character (svalakṣaṇa) is the
absence of essential character (alakṣaṇa), the open space has no essential character and
it is characterized as all dharmas.When this religious discourse was given by the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja, twelve thousand Brahmās in the assembly produced the thought of the incomparable
complete awakening, and five thousand Brahmās, who had planted the well prepared roots
of good (parikarmāvaropitakuśalamūla), attained the tolerance that all things are unborn
(anutpattikadharmakṣānti).

in those one hundred twenty-eight dharmas.Son of good family, this is the brief explanation
of all dharmas (sarvadharmasamāsanirdeśa). If I were to explain the dharmas in more
than one word or more than two words, the true state of the dharmas (dharmāṇāṃ dharmatā)
