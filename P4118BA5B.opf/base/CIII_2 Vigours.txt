Son of good family, the bodhisatvas have two types of vigour. What are these two? (dvāv imau
kulaputra bodhisatvānāṃ vīrye. katamau dvau?)Namely, the vigour of application (prayogavīrya)
and the vigour of determination (paricchedavīrya).The vigour of application is connected
with body, speech, and thought (tatra prayogavīryaṃ kāyavākcittapratisaṃyuktam).The vigour
of determination is without grasping, giving up, and its basis (utpādanotsargāvasthita).The
vigour of application (prayogavīrya) which is connected with the bodhisatva’s body,
speech, and thought (kāyavākcitta) cannot be perceived since it has no basis; the vigour
of determination is in accordance with the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu).Thus
the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space.
