Then the bodhisatva, the great being named Pradīpapāṇi came and sat down in this assembly, and
addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu pradīpapāṇir nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tatraiva
pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt sanniṣaṇṇo bhagavantam etad avocat):“O Lord, which bodhisatva
becomes one who gives away in this way? (ko bhagavan bodhisatva evaṃparityāgo bhavati)?”The
Lord said (bhagavān āha): “Son of good family (kulaputra), the bodhisatvas, the great
beings who are beyond forms (nirākāra) because they are pure of form (ākāraviśuddha);who have
the appearance of living beings (satvākāra) because [they see] the purity of living beings
(satvaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of the dharma (dharmākāra) because [they see]
the purity of the dharma (dharmaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of knowledge (jñānākāra)
because [they see] the purity of knowledge (jñānaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of insight
(prajñākāra) because [they see] the purity of insight (prajñāviśuddhi);who have the
appearance of thought (cittākāra) because [they see] the purity of consciousness (cittaviśuddhi);who
have the appearance of the world (lokākāra) because [they see] the purity of the
world (lokaviśuddhi);who are formless but manifest themselves in form (rūpa); whose wisdom
of non-manifestation is pure;who are beyond darkness (andhakāra) because they illuminate
darkness;who reached to the limit of distinguishing marks (nimittaparyanta) by the annihilation
of all distinguishing marks (sarvanimittavināśa);who purified their knowledge which
reached to its limit (niṣṭhāgatajānaviśudda);who are endowed with inexhaustible patience
(akṣayakṣamāvat);who have attained the prediction (vyākaraṇa) that they will understand the
knowledge of the Tathāgata (tathāgatajñāna);who have set the boundary [for practice] (sīmābandha)
and entered into the state of being determined as a bodhisatva (bodhisatvaniyāmāvakranti);who
have attained the consecration (abhiṣekapratilambha) as sealed with the seal
of non-retrogression (avinivartanamudrāmudrita);being on the way to attain all qualities
of the Buddha, who practice with universal sameness (sarvabuddhadarmasaṃprasthitāḥ samatayā
samācaranti)and have practiced good deeds (sucarita).This is the range of the bodhisatvas,
the great beings who know the way and characteristics of the behaviour of all living beings
(sa sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇavidhijñānāṃ bodhsatvānāṃ māhāsatvānāṃ gocaraḥ),and those
good men give a gift in such a way (te satpuruṣā evaṃ dānaṃ dadati).When this teaching had
been declared (iha nirdeśe nirdiśyamāne), sixteen thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance
[that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣāntipratilabdha)] in the sky-like giving
(gaganasamadāna).Then, the Lord went on to speak these verses (atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ
velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata).
