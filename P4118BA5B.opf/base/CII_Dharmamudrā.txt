When the bodhisatvas rose into the vault of the sky, they listened to the preaching of the tathāgata.
And the tathāgata taught the dharma-seal named gaganapariśuddhi. (sa tathāgato gaganapariśuddhir
iti dharmamudrāṃ saṃprakāśayati sma)O Śāriputra, it is impossible to enumerate
the usufructs (paribhoga) of the bodhisatvas in the pavilion of the Mahāvyūha for their
entire lifespan.O Śāriputra, do you see this lion’s throne?” He said “Yes. O Lord, I see
it.” (paśyasi śāriputraṃ siṃhāsanam | āha | paśyāmi bhagavan |)The Lord said: “O Śāriputra,
the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha, seating in the lion’s throne thus, explained the Dharma-seal
called Gaganapariśuddhi to these bodhisatvas, which has thirty-two aspects of entrance
(amīṣāṃ bodhisatvānāṃ gaganapariśuddhim dharmamudrām dvātriṃśadākārapraveśām saṃprakāśayati
sma).What is this Dharma-seal called Gaganapariśuddhi which has thirty-two forms of entrance
(katamā dvātriṃśadākārapreveśā gaganapariśuddhir dharmamudrā)? 1Namely, 1) all moments
of existence are free from existence and non-existence because they have no proper nature
(tad yathā sarvadharmā bhāvābhāvavigatā niḥsvabhāvena);2) all moments of existence are
without a proper nature, because of their essential characteristic of cognition (sarvadharmā
niḥsvabhāvā vijñaptilakṣaṇena);3) all moments of existence are without cognition because
they are invisible (sarvadharmā avijñaptayo ’dṛśyena);4) all moments of existence are invisible
because they lack causes and objects (sarvadharmā adṛśyā hetvālambanavigatena);5)
all moments of existence lack objects because they are calm (sarvadharmā anālambanā upaśāntalakṣaṇena);6)
all moments of existence are clam because they are without duality (sarvadharmā
upaśāntā advayena) ;7) all moments of existence are without duality because of their
homogeneity (sarvadharmā advayā asaṃbhedena);8) all moments of existence are without difference
as they can be approached with one principle (sarvadharmā asaṃbhedā ekanayapraveśena);9)
all moments of existence can be approached with one principle because they have no
essential character of proper being (sarvadharmā ekanayapraveśāḥ svabhāvalakṣaṇavigatena);10)
all moments of existence have no essential character of proper being because they completely
transcend the three times (sarvadharmā svabhāvalakṣaṇavigatās tryadhvasamatikrāntena);11)
all moments of existence are like the vault of the sky because they are not dependent
on anything (sarvadharmā gaganatale sarvato ’pratiṣṭhitā aniśritena);12) all moments of
existence is the entry into not being established anywhere because they are not manifested
anywhere (sarvadharmā apratiṣṭhitapraveśāḥ sarvatrānābhāsena);13) all moments of existence
are not manifested anywhere because they completely transcend the perceptual objects (sarvadharmā
anābhāsā gocaramārgasamatikrāntena);14) all moments of existence are without objects
because of their purity of inner and outer (sarvadharmā aviṣayā ādhyātmabāhyaviśuddhyā);15)
all moments of existence are thoroughly pure because they are essentially beyond vices
(sarvadharmā viśuddhāḥ svabhāvāsaṃkliṣṭena);16) all moments of existence are fully purified
because of their essential tranquility (sarvadharmā prakṛtipariśuddhāḥ svabhāvopaśāntena);17)
all moments of existence are tranquil because they are free from thought, mind
and consciousness (sarvadharmā upaśāntā cittamanovijñānavigatena);18) all moments of existence
lack characteristics because they are non-originated from the very beginning (sarvadharmā
svalakṣaṇavigatā ādyanutpannena);19) all moments of existence are non-originated from
the beginning because they are beyond what belongs to the ego and appropriation (sarvadharmā
ādyanutpannā amamāparigraheṇa ca);20) all moments of existence are beyond what belongs
to the ego and appropriation because they have no owner (sarvadharmā amamā aparigrahāś ca
svāmikavigatena);21) all moments of existence have no owner because they are essentially
selfless (sarvadharmā asvāmikavigatāḥ svabhāvenānātmanā);22) all moments of existence are
essentially selfless because they are originally pure (sarvadharmāḥ svabhāvenānātmāna ādiviśuddhyā);23)
all moments of existence are originally pure because they never turn back (sarvadharmā
ādiviśuddhā avinivartanena);24) all moments of existence never turn back because
their essence has the characteristic of an illusion (sarvadharmā avinivartanīyā māyālakṣaṇasvabhāvena);25)
all moments of existence are like an illusion because they have no proper
nature (sarvadharmā māyāsamā niḥsvabhāvena);26) all moments of existence have no proper
nature because their essential characteristics are unconditioned (sarvadharmā niḥsvabhāvā
anabhisaṃskāralakṣaṇena);27) all moments of existence are unconditioned because of being
detached from mind and body (sarvadharmā anabhisaṃskārāś cittakāyavivekena);28) all moments
of existence have the transcendent essential character because they are beyond characteristics
and do not have the character of characterizing something to be characterized (sarvadharmā
vivekalakṣaṇā alakṣaṇalakṣyalakṣaṇālakṣaṇa);29) all moments of existence lack characteristics
because their defining character is neutralised (sarvadharmā alakṣaṇāḥ svalakṣaṇāniñjena);30)
all moments of existence are neutral because they lack place of objective
supports (sarvadharmā aniñjitāḥ sthānānālambhena);31) all moments of existence lack place
[of objective supports] because they are firmly rooted beyond objectification (sarvadharmā
asthānā anālambanapratiṣṭitena);32) all moments of existence are beyond objectification because
they lack basis of all (sarvadharmā anālambanā anālayena);33) all moments of existence
lack basis of all because they are free from basis of all (sarvadharmā ālayā ālayavigatena);In
this way, Śāriputra, the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha elucidated the Dharma-seal called
Gaganapariśuddhi to the bodhisatvas, which has thirty-two forms of entrance. Having heard
that, innumerable bodhisatvas attained (pratilabdha) the mastery of all moments of existence
(sarvadharmādhipatya) and the tolerance (kṣānti) based on the pure cognition (viśuddhajñāna)
by supernormal knowledge (abhijñā).
