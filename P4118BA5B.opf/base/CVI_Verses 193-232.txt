193 When the highest among humans was extinguished, O Lord, we will even sacrifice our bodies
and lives to uphold the true dharma..(vayam utsahāmo bhagavan nirvṛte dvipadottame |saddharma

Leaving gain and fame, leaving all praises, but never leaving behind this
dharma which sets forth the knowledge of the Buddha.(lābhasatkāram utsṛṣṭvā sarvaṃ cotsṛjya

In order to uphold the true dharma, with patience we will endure the words of abuse, censure
and reviling. (ākrośaparibhāṣāṃś ca duruktavacanāni ca |kṣāntyā tān marṣayiṣyāmaḥ saddharmapratisaṃgrahāt

There will be monks who, being attached to objects (ālambana), as
the messengers or partisans of the Māra (mārapakṣa), deny the true dharma (saddharma).198
Having bad morality (duḥśīla) and non-dharma (adharma), staying close to secular people, desiring
fame and gain, they will not seek the dharma.199 Being mingled with materialists (lokāyata),
praising themselves, disparaging noble ones, they will be ignorant and arrogant.200
Giving up to stay in the wilderness (araṇya), always taking pleasure among the crowds
of people (saṃsarga), practicing worldly incantations (laukikamantra), they will be attached
to [the view] that there is a permanent substance (satkāya).201 The ignorant among monks,
devoting themselves to observances, giving up to practice meditation (dhyāna), will not
act in accordance with the three jewels (triratna).202 Without learning or morality, seeking
a profit within the congregation, and exerting themselves all over the time to get gifts,
they will be full of thought-constructions (vikalpa) with distress (śoka).203 Holding
the concept of self (ātmasaṃjñā), taking pleasure in begging at the homes [of lay people]
together with friends, and entering into them, they will engage in discourses on worldly
things.204 Engaging in farming, housework, and business, having ploughs and harrows, they
will still say “We are ascetics (śramaṇa).”205 Being attached to objects (ālambana), being
established in various views (nānādṛṣṭi), after having heard the teaching of emptiness (śūnyatādharma),
they will [regard it] as the abyss (prapāta).206 Not concerned with the next
world (paraloka), giving up the fruition of actions (karmavipāka), and telling lies (mṛṣāvāda),
they will regard the non-dharma as the dharma.207 In such a time of great terror and
disruption for living beings, agitating ascetics and kings alike, we will uphold the true
dharma.(evaṃ vighe mahāghore bhikṣurājānakṣobhaṇe1 |vilopakāle satvānāṃ saddharma dhārayāmahe

Any of the sūtras will not be collected nor practiced;
they will always believe what they say.209 The profound sūtras which are composed
for the fruit of liberation will not be accepted; they will be fond of colorful tales.(gambhīrā

destroyed.211 Then, under the tyranny of the kings, living beings will be destroyed and [try
to] escape from the fear and terror (bhayabhīṭā).212 Even though the time of destruction
is intolerable2 just like the time of wickedness, we will uphold this dharma taught by the
buddha.213 Upholding this guiding principle, we will show friendliness and compassion even
to living beings who do not live by the dharma.(maitrīṃ teṣu kariṣyāmo ye dharmeṣv apratiṣṭhitāḥ

to be firm in realization at the time of destruction. This is not mere words.232 O
King of the dharma (dharmarāja), the Light-maker (prabhākara), when this true dharma will
be grasped, how much accumulation of merits (puṇyasaṃbhāra) will be there?

At that time, the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Even if, son of good family,
every thirty thousand world-system in the east is broken into the atomic-sized raindrops
or the atomic-sized particles, and in the same way every thirty thousand world-system in the
south, west, north, above, below and ten directions is also broken into the atomic-sized
particles, and even if the buddha-fields in east, as numerous as all the particles, are
put into one single atomic-sized particle, and in the same way, even if one calculates every
single particle in the east until it is exhausted, it would not be enough to equal with
the number of the buddha-fields,and just like in the east, the buddha-fields in each of the
ten directions are immeasurable.What do you think, son of good family (tat kiṃ manyase
kulaputra), can you calculate the particles in the ten directions, each of them contains the
buddha-fields of the ten directions in such a way? Can you understand its limit?”Gaganagañja
replied: “O Lord, nobody can do that. But the tathāgata is an exception, who knows it
by means of the unattached knowledge of the buddha (buddhāsaṅgajñāna).”The Lord said: “If,
son of good family, in all such buddha-fields there is a place in which the particles are
posited, if all the buddha-fields become a town after having been encircled by a wall,
and if the town, from its subterranean mass of water up to its highest point, is filled with
only mustard seeds without roughness, then, what do you think, son of good family, how
many mustard seeds would be there?”Gaganagañja said: “O Lord, it is marvelous that such analogy
was sought out by the tathāgata. Having heard this analogy, O Lord, those living beings
with faith will come to be endowed with a most marvelous thing (āścaryādbhutadharma).”The
Lord said: “Son of good family, how many hundreds of, how many thousands of, how many
hundred thousands of, how many vivāhas of, or how many akṣobhyas of mustard seeds there are,
or how many buddha-fields there are, how many hundreds of buddha-fields there are, how
many thousands of buddha-fields there are, or how many hundred thousands of buddha-fields
there are, all of them the tathāgata knows.Even though, son of good family, one who want to
reach awakening fills so many buddha-fields with seven kinds of precious jewels (saptaratna)
giving them as a gift for the sake of awakening, if anybody grasps the true dharma and
is established in such dharma of good qualities, then he who grasps the true dharma of one
tathāgata will generate a lot more merit.Even though one honours, reveres, worships, adores
and respects the buddhas as numerous as mustards seeds, if anybody accepts the profound
dharma (gambhīradharma), then he will generate a lot more merit.Even though one makes endless
offerings as numerous as mustard seeds, if anybody makes the seven steps (saptapada),
taking pleasure in and enduring the dharma without any hostility towards all beings (sarvasatvāpratihatacitta),
he will generate a lot more merit.Even though one [accomplishes the
works of] Indras, Brahmās, universal kings and bodhisatvas (śakrabrahmacakravartirājabodhisatva)
as numerous as mustard seeds, if anybody, who knows that all conditioned things
are impermanent and suffering (sarvaṃ saṃskṛtam anityaduḥkham), who understands that extinction
is calm (śāntaṃ nirvāṇam), engenders the great compassion for all beings (satveṣu mahākaruṇotpadyate)
and produces the thought of incomparable complete awakening for the sake
of keeping the succession of the three jewels unbroken (triratnavaṃśasyānupacchedanārthaṃ),
then he will generate a lot more merit.

VII. Transmission

Cāturmahārāja

Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, please give the tathāgata’s
blessing over this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) so that, in the latter time,
in the latter age (paścimakāle paścimasamaye), it will be disseminated and practiced
throughout the Jambūdvīpa.”The Lord said: “For that reason, son of good family, I will invoke
the Four Great Kings (cāturmahārāja) so that they will come and strive to keep this exposition
of religion for a long time (dharmaparyāyacirasthti) with detailed and analytical
explanation (vistaravibhāganirdeśa).These are the words for invoking: tadyathā | dhudhure
| dhidhire | dhvajavati | dhvajālaṃkāre | āvartani | śame śamavati | śāntimukhe | nigrahaparapakṣa
| anuttara | uttaravigama | samapatha | pathaśuddhi | pathānugama | pathasandhi
| prajñāmukhe | āryakule | bhūtarakṣa ame sacca mene sacca tama sacca tatama sacca | buddhapāda
| dharmānusandhi | āryagaṇānugama | āryanirghātani | ruṣṭaprāsādani | īśvarapadalokacittikṛte
| anurāgayantu | imān dharmasandhi | vibhajantu nirukte | nirdeśe pratirakṣantu
| dharmadhāraṇī |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the Four Great Kings.”Then
the Four Great Kings, having become scared and fearful (bhayabhīṭa), approached the
Lord, prostrated themselves at the Lord’s feet, and said this to the Lord:“O Lord, we, the
Four Great Kings will protect, shield, guard (rakṣāvaraṇagupti) this exposition of religion
(dharmaparyāya) so that it may last long and be beneficial.Wherever this exposition of
religion is practiced, if there are devas, nāgas, yakśas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas or
kiṃnaras (devanāgayakṣagandharvāsuragaruḍakinnara) who want the destruction of the dharma,
we will subjugate them.Whosoever seek for the dharma, we will make them happy.We will offer
hospitality to the congregation of the dharma-reciter (dharmabhāṇakaparṣanmaṇḍala), never
forget the meaning of the words to be connected to the words (padānusaṃdhyasaṃpramoṣatā),
give inspiration (pratibhāna), and increase recollection, intelligence, understanding and
happiness (smṛtimatiprativedhamuditā).At these words, the Lord said this to the Four Great
Kings: “Excellent, excellent, friends, you are my sons born of the dharma, and all of
you demonstrate the effort to uphold my true dharma (saddharmaparigraha). With the outcome
of the dharma (dharmaniṣyanda) all of you will be the masters of the world in this world,
and after having transcended all the world, you will attain the final extinction (nirvāṇa)
in the realm of noble extinction (āryanirvāṇadhātu).”

Śakra Devānām Indra

Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, I will invoke Śakra,
the lord of the gods (śakro devānām indraḥ), and by pronouncing the knowledge-mantra
(vidyāmantra) he will remain for protecting this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) so
that it may last long. The mantra is as follows:tadyathā | śubhe | śubhamati | śubhavyūhe
| dudare |10 daride |11 duraṇi | dame śame | upaśame | khube | ugaśame | khabe | ugakhare
| asomukhe | dhāraṇi | araddi | suśruṣe | sahite | abhede bhedadandhi saume samavati samarasmi
| aśe | huhu | hehe | khurukhure | anatikrame | devarakṣasahe he mahābhāvabhāsabrame
| āgacchatu śakro devānāṃ | mantradaśaśatanayena12 | brahmakuṭadhāra | īśvara umarut babhana
nivasi |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the lord of gods by which
he will be invoked and remain for this exposition of religion to last long.”Because of the
impact of the dharma (dharmapravega), the lord of the gods became full of happiness and
all his dwelling places in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven were shaken. Then, together with many hundreds
of thousands of attendant gods, he approached to the Lord, prostrated himself at the
Lord’s feet, and said this to the Lord:“O Lord, I am Śakra, the lord of gods, who have
the mastery of the gods in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. Together with a multitude of attendant
gods, I will strive to disseminate this exposition of religion throughout the Jambūdvīpa.I
will never do violence to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) who retain this sūtra, delight
in them, have faith in them, and adorn them by adornments of the dharma. Wherever they
teach this exposition of religion in a village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama),
kingdom (rāṣṭra) or capital (rājadhāni), I will protect, shield and guard them.O Lord, I will
go to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) in order to listen the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa).[Even
if someone] insults or abuses [the preachers of the dharma,] I will make him accept
them.13I will protect, shield and guard them from the harmful obstruction of Māra.”The Lord
said: “Excellent, excellent, Kauśika, since you have obtained the power of gods, you,
having entered into the power of the dharma, will roar the lion’s road (siṃhanādanādi) in
order to uphold all the buddha’s true dharma (saddharma).Why is that? Kauśika, if you uphold
the true dharma of one tathāgata, then you are also upholding the true dharma of the Awakened
Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).”

Brahmā Sahāṃpati

Then the Lord said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Then, son of good family, I will invoke the
Brahmā, the lord of Sahā (brahmā sahāṃpati), and because of that he will continue protecting
this exposition of religion. The words of invoking is as follows:tadyathā | maitre |
śubhamaitre | dharmamaitre | maitryānusahite samaitre | sandhimaitre | anugamamaitre | anugacchamaitre
| anuttāramaitre | sātramaitre | dharmamaitre | anugrahamaitre | apratisārimaitre

| o no o no nur oṃ dhe | virodhamaitre | o to mo maitre | brahmapathamaitre | dhyānālaṃkaramaitre

nitramamahāvimanāda | viavalokāya | jambudvipanakuruśādharmarakṣāna | mātikramabuddhādhiṣṭhānāṃ
|Those treasuries of open space are the words of invoking the Brahā,
the lord of Sahā.”Then the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, dwelling in the heaven of Brahmā
(brahmaloka), became aware of the presence of the buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna), heard these words
of friendly mantra (maitrīmantra) by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva), namely the
sphere of divine hearing (divyaśrotradhātu), together with sixty-eight hundred thousand
Brahmās, approached to the Lord, prostrated himself at the Lord’s feet, and sat down on a
side.Having sat down on a side, the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, addressed himself to the Lord:
“O Lord, since we are sustained by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhita),
we will be endowed with friendliness and compassion (maitrīkaruṇā) and strive for
this exposition of religion.As for the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka), who, having collected
this teaching of the buddha, understand it, retain it, read it, teach it, and make it
into a book (pustaka), wherever they hold religious discourses (dharmakathā) in the wilderness
(araṇya), forest (utpathamārga), village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama), kingdom
(rāṣṭra) or capital (rājadhāni), if they explain this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya)
in detail, then we will protect them, shield them, guard them, rejoice them, fulfill
energy (bala), attain recollection (smṛti), acquire intelligence (mati), be accordance
with realization (prativedha), fulfill eloquence (pratibhāna), inspire the unbelieving with
faith, and liberate those who have faith. According to the tathāgata’s guiding principle
of the dharma (tathāgatadharmanaya), Lord, we will uphold and disseminate it”At these words,
the Lord said this to the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā: “Excellent, excellent, Brahmā, since
you uphold the true dharma, the tathāgata rejoices in you.Just as I am turning the wheel
of the dharma (dharmacakra), just so, Brahmā, you also will before long turn it.Just as
you are upholding my true dharma, just so other Brahmās will uphold your true dharma.”

Bodhisatva Maitreya

Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Maitreya: “O Maitreya, I entrust
(parindāmi) you with this [teaching of] incomparable complete awakening, which has been established
for countless hundreds of millions of aeons, in order that it will be memorized,
understood, read, and elucidated in detail to others, in order to give thanks and gratitude
to the tathāgata, fulfill my aspirations (abhiprāya), increase and purify many beings’
roots of good (kuśalamūla), make the bodhisatvas attain the light of the dharma (dharmāloka),
subjugate all Māras, defeat all heretics (tīrthika), uphold the dharma of the highest
meaning (paramārthadharma), and in order not to break the continuity of the three jewels (triratnavaṃśānupaccheda).”At
these words, the bodhisatva Maitreya addressed himself to the
Lord: “O Lord, I will protect this unexcelled treasury of the Dharma Jewel (anuttaradharmaratnanidhāna)
for the sake of the complete extinction of the tathāgata (tathāgataparinirvāṇa).Why
is that? Because, Lord, this is the true dharma (saddharma) of myself and the Awakened
Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).O Lord, when I have
dwelled in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha), I have strived for protecting, upholding,
and keeping these sūtras for a long time.O Lord, in the latter time, in the latter age (paścimakāle
paścimasameye), if someone were to hear this true sūtra, grasp it, retain it,
recite it, fully explain it to others, and practice it himself, may you know that it is because
of the sustaining power of maitreya (maitreyādhiṣṭhāna).If, Lord, the partisans of the
Māra were to attack, even further, if the root of goods were to fill up every pore of my
whole body, and then if all living beings in the world system of three thousand worlds were
to become the wicked Māras, they do not approach even a hundredth part of the root of
goods in one of the pores and so on, until nor do they approach even the likeness of it (ekaromakūpasya
kuśalamūlaḥ śatatamīm api kalāṃ nopaiti yāvad upamām api nopaiti).O Lord, as
all regions of Māras (sarvamāramaṇḍala) were conquered by the power of my merits (puṇyabala)
and the power of my knowledge (jñānabala), this awakening will be protected by the tathāgata
for countless millions.”The Lord said: “Good, good, Maitreya, these four are the bodhisatva’s
actions. What four? 1) conquering all Māras and vices (sarvamārakleśanigraha);
2) defeating all opponents (sarvaparapravādin) in accordance with the dharma (dharmānulomikābhibhava);
3) bringing all beings to maturity (satvaparipācana); 4) upholding the true dharma
(saddharmaparigraha).Those four actions are belonging to one, namely, upholding the
true dharma (saddharmaparigraha).”

Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda

Then the Lord said this to the elder Mahākāśyapa and the venerable Ānanda: “Mahākāśyapa and
Ānanda, I entrust (parindāmi) you with this [teaching of] incomparable complete awakening
so that it will be memorized, understood, read and elucidated to others.”The Mahākāśyapa said:
“O Lord, we will uphold this awakening of the tathāgata with all my might.”The Ānanda
said: “O Lord, we will take up this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) and disseminate
it by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhāna).”

Bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra

Then the bodhisatva, the great being Puṇyālaṃkāra addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, what
the Lord had said (tathāgatabhāṣita) in this sūtra is deep and profound in illumination,
free from mental activity (pracāra), difficult to see its explicit meaning (nītārthadurdṛśya),
difficult to understand (duradhigamya), endowed with the higher truth (paramārtha),
namely emptiness (śūnyatā), adorned with the adornment of morality (śīlālaṃkārālaṃkṛta), producing
recollection (smṛti), concentration (samādhi), penetration (nirvedhika) and happiness
in thought (manaspraharṣaṇa), illuminating the light of insight (prajñāraśmi), revealing
liberation (vimukti), peaceful, unsullied, known by the wise and accomplished ones, praised
and extolled by all buddhas (sarvabuddhasaṃstutapraśasta), sealed with the seal of the
king of memory and sūtras (dhāraṇīsūtrāntarājamudrāmudrita), grasping the unhindered eloquence
(apratihatapratibhānagrahaṇa), increasing recollection, intelligence, understanding
and confidence (smṛtimatiprativedhādhimuktivivardhana), not surpassed by any Māra or adversary
(sarvamārapratyarthikānabhibhūta), rebuking immoral beings (duḥśīla), established in
the dharma which is the qualities of purity, austerity, fulfilling vows and the qualities
of giving (dhūtaguṇasaṃlekhasaṃvaraniryātatyāgaguṇadharmapratiṣṭhita), and originated from
endless good merits (anantaguṇadharmanirjāta). If sons of good family or daughters of good
family were to bear this teaching and knowledge of all the buddhas in their minds, grasp
it, retain it, read it, master it, elucidate it to others, write it, copy it, recite it,
think about it, examine it, reflect on it, and be established in the progress (pratipattipratiṣṭhita),
then how much merit (puṇya) they will generate?”Then the Lord spoke the following
verses to the bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra:
