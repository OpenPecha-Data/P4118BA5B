22. DharmanayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva enter into the profound guiding
principle of the dharma (gambhīradharmanayapraveśa) which is difficult for disciples and
isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddha) to understand (prativedhya)?What is called
‘profound (gambhīra),’ son of good family, is the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda).The
way of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanaya) is like this: formative factors
are caused by ignorance; consciousness is caused by formative factors; name and form are
caused by consciousness; the six fields of sense-perception is caused by name and form;
touch is caused by the six fields of sense-perception; feeling is caused by touch; thirst
is caused by feeling; grasping is caused by thirst; existence is caused by grasping; birth
is caused by existence; ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression, and
despair are caused by birth. Thus this great mass of utter suffering originates.(yad uta

of living beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, this is called the guiding
principle of the origin of the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādasamudayanaya).What
then is the guiding principle of the cessation of the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya)?To
wit, cessation of formative factors is caused by cessation of ignorance
comes; cessation of consciousness is caused by cessation of formative factors; cessation
of name and form is caused by cessation of consciousness; cessation of the six fields
of sense-perception is caused by cessation of name and form; cessation of touch is caused
by cessation of the six fields of sense-perception; cessation of feeling is caused by cessation
of touch; cessation of thirst is caused by cessation of feeling; cessation of grasping
is caused by cessation of thirst; cessation of existence is caused by cessation of grasping;
cessation of birth is caused by cessation of existence comes; cessation of ageing,
death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression and despair is caused by cessation of
birth. Thus this great mass of utter suffering ceases.(yad uta avidyānirodhāt saṃskāranirodhaḥ,

duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati evam asya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati)This,
son of good family, is the guiding principle of dependent origination ceasing (pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya).What
are the causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) for the purification
(vyavadāna) of living beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, though
any disciple or isolated buddha [cannot enter], this is called the entrance into the
profound guiding principle of dharma.Why is that? Because both the vices of all living beings
and the knowledge of purification (sarvasatvakleśavyavadānajñāna) belong to the sphere
of the Awakened Lords (buddhagacara),and the bodhisatva understands these connetions (anusaṃdhi)
by his own knowledge (ātmajñāna) and the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhāna).Further,
what we called ‘profound (gambhīra)’ is concerned with essential entities (satkāya).As
the self is pure (ātmaviśuddhi), thus all dharmas are pure (sarvadharmaviśuddhi).Why?
If you really search for essential entities (satkāya), they can never be grasped (nopalabhyante).That
which can never be grasped is ‘profound (gambhīra).’The self has never been
grasped by any buddha.Why is that?The self is originally pure (ādiviśuddha), and just as
the self is pure, so all dharmas are pure.Why do we say ‘pure (viśuddha)’?Since any dharma
is unoriginated (anutpanna) and beyond origination (anutpāda), not ceased (aniruddha), and
beyond cessation (anirodha), it is called ‘pure (viśuddha).’In what is beyond darkness (andhakāra),
beyond manifestation (anābhāsa), without basis (anālaya) and blindness (timira),
in what is the deep and highest truth (gaṃbhīraparamārtha), there is no sight (cakṣur)
or cessation of sight, up to and including no mind (manas) or cessation of mind, that is the
space of objects (gocara) where there is no calculation (gaṇanā).That which makes the space
of objects (gocara), being a space without objects, that is the highest truth (paramārtha),
and that is why it is called ‘profound (gambhīra).’Because it cannot be grasped by
thought and mind (acittamanogrāhya), it is difficult to understand (duradhigamya), difficult
to see (durdṛśya), and difficult to comprehend (duḥprativedhya). But he, not dependent
on others in respect of knowledge (jñānāparapraṇeya), still teaches this profound guiding
principle of dharma to other living beings (parasatvān gambhīradharmanayaṃ pradeśayati),This
is the entrance into the profound guiding principle of dharma (gambhīradharmanayapraveśa)
of the bodhisatva, which is hard for disciples and isolated buddhas to fathom (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhaduravagāha).
