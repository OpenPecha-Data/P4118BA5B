Ratnaśrī

gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 6Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī addressed himself to the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, was the supramunane way purified by you?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, it was purified by purifying myself.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good
family, how did you purify yourself?”Gaganagañja said: “Since this world is pure, son of
good family, I am originally pure.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is the purity
of the world?”Gaganagañja said: “Since the form (rūpa) is originally pure, it is deathless
(acyuta).Since the form in the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the form
in the present is pure, it is established in the true state (dharmatāsthita).In the same
way, since the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are originally pure, those are deathless.Since the consciousness (vijñāna) in
the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the consciousness in the present is pure,
it is established in the true state (dharmatā). Son of good family, this is the purity
of the world.”Ratnaśrī said: “As for the pure world, where can we see it?”Gaganagañja said:
“Son of good family, you can see such pure world in all dharmas.”Ratnaśrī said: “How can
we see all the dharmas?"Gaganagañja said: “It is when we know how to distinguish the past
and future of all dharmas by means of insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna)”Ratnaśrī said:
“How do you distinguish the past and future of all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there
is no cessation (pariccheda) or eternity (śāśvata).”Ratnaśrī said: “Where is no cessation
or eternity?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there is no cessation or eternity there is no origination
or extinction (anutpannāniruddhatā).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this place without origination
or extinction?”Gaganagañja said: “It cannot be verbally expressed.”Ratnaśrī said:
“Why is that?”Gaganagañja said: “Because the dharma is incalculable and ineffable.”Ratnaśrī:
“Son of good family, how can you count the incalculable dharmas (asaṃkhyeyadharma)?”Gaganagañja
said: “Just as, even though on the earth it is possible to measure open space,
in open space it is impossible, just so, even though it is possible to measure by means of
calculation (gaṇanamukhena), it is still impossible to measure by means of calculation. This
is because the nature of the means of calculation is non-calculation.”Ratnaśrī said: “What
then are the means of calculation and the means without calculation?”Gaganagañja said:
“The means of calculation is conditioned (saṃskṛta), and the means without calculation is
unconditioned (asaṃskṛta).Therefore, that which is without calculation in the unconditioned
is beyond calculation, and that which is beyond calculation is unconditioned, thus the
Lord said that by means of insight one should calculate, investigate, and give up what is
to be given up.Accordingly, when the bodhisatva calculates the dharma in the conditioned,
measures it in his consciousness, and reflects on it in the right way, he never sees any
dharma which is to be fully known (parijñeya), to be eliminated (prahātavya), to be realized
(sākṣātkartavya), or to be cultivated (bhāvayitavya).Since the bodhisatva never sees any
dharma, he does not establish any dharma.Where he does not establish any dharma, there is
the attainment of the absence of basis (anālaya).Where he attains the absence of basis,
there is not anything to be wanted.Where there is nothing to be wanted, there is nothing to
be obtained.Since he is free from mental conception (upalambha), there is nothing related
to the self (amama) or nothing to be grasped (aparigraha).What is non-grasping? It is not
grasping permanence or impermanence in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative
factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna);it is not grasping suffering or happiness
in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness; it
is not grasping the self or selflessness in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative
factors or consciousness;it is not grasping the beautiful or the ugly in from, as well
as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or] consciousness; it is not grasping emptiness
or non-emptiness in from, as well as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or]
consciousness.Even though he does not grasp anything, he attains concentration (samādhi).
He stays within existence (saṃsāra), but he never grasps any vice of existence.Even though
he makes living beings believe in extinction, he attained extinction from the beginning
(ādiparinirvṛta).What then is the extinction of the bodhisatva?Extinction (parinirvāṇa) is
the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta).Even though the bodhisatva never makes even a small bad
action (akuśalakarman), he still enters into grasping for the good actions (kuśaladharma).Since
the bodhisatva makes all composite things (sarvasaṃskṛta) as belonging to body, speech,
and mind (kāyavākcitta), he, having investigated them, transforms them into omniscience.He
does not seek omniscience as form nor feeling, nor perception, nor formative factors,
nor consciousness.Because he is not attached to his thoughts and morality, while fulfilling
all his vows (sarvapraṇidhāna), he never sees (na samanupaśyati) the dharma in which
there is increase or decrease.Since the dharma does not decrease nor increase, the bodhisatva,
having attained the sameness of all dharmas (sarvadharmasamatā), performs the practice
of a bodhisatva, being established in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu), thus he neither
performs nor practices any dharma.Son of good family, the bodhisatva who has attained such
extinction performs the practice of the bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā).Why is that? When
the bodhisatva is established in the unconditioned (abhisaṃskāra) among all constructed,
he attains extinction, and therefore the bodhisatva does not construct things among all the
constructed things. Thus the unconditioned is called ‘extinction (parinirvāṇa)’ because
it is not conditioned.Since the other shore (pāra) is that which does not enter into consciousness
(vijñāna), the bodhisatva is characterized (prabhāvita) as having no conceptual activity
(avijñapti), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is without distinguishing
marks (animitta), the bodhisatva does not transform his thoughts into distinguishing
marks, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is beyond false imagination
(parikalpa), his thoughts do not enter into the imagination, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since
the other shore is baseless, he does not transform his thoughts into the absence
of basis (anālaya), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Therefore, son of good family, this is
the extinction of the bodhisatva, namely performing the practice of the bodhisatva.Then
the Lord applauded the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjāya
bodhisatvāya mahāsatvāya sādhukāram adāt): “Well done, good man, well done (sādhu
sādhu satpuruṣa). If it should be explained, I will say like that.”When this teaching was
declared, five hundred bodhisatvas produced the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)].Then
the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja addressed himself
to the Lord: “O Lord, we attained eloquence by this light of the dharma from the tathāgata
(tathāgatadharmāloka).Just as forms appear in dependence on light, so we attained shining
eloquence by the power generated by the tathāgata.”Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī said this
to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, why do you hide your knowledge and teach
that you attained eloquence by the presence of the Buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna)?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, all the eloquence of the bodhisatvas, even a small part of it,
should be seen as the presence of the Buddha. Why is that? If the buddhas do not make those
dharmas appear, how could the bodhisatva attain eloquence?”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good
family, how is the eloquence transferred?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, there is
no transference [of eloquence,] but, nevertheless, the eloquence is attained by the eloquence
of the Buddha.”Just as, even though ignorance (avidyā) is not transferred to the formative
factors (saṃskāra), the formative factors are produced by the cause of ignorance, just
so, even though the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere, by its cause
the eloquence still arises.Just as the sounds of horses, elephants, and human beings (hayagajamanuṣyakāḥ
śabdāḥ) are not transferred to an echo (pratiśrutkā) but because of it the
echo (pratiśrutkā) arises, just so the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere
but by its cause the eloquence still arises.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, dependent
origination (pratītyasamutpāda) is profound (gambhīra).”Gaganagañja said: “In the same way
any dharma is never born.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is it that there is
no dependent origination of any dharma?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, if a certain
agent (kartṛ) is in conditions, the dharmas will be born, but, because any agent is not
apprehended in conditions, the agent is not apprehended in any dharma.Ratnaśrī said: “Son
of good family, what is it that the Tathāgata never appears?”Gaganagañja said: “if suchness
arises, the tathāgata will appear, but still we hold the view that suchness never arises.
Why is that? Suchness is brought about (prabhāvita) through non-arising. One who understands
all dharmas just like the suchness, he is called the tathāgata.Ratnaśrī said: “Son of
good family, why did the tathāgata come?”Gaganagañja said: “Something like that should be
let alone (sthāpanīya).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this letting alone?”Gaganagañja said: “Because
the absolute truth (dharmadhātu) is in accordance with its proper place (yathāsthāna).”Ratnaśrī
said: “What is the place of the absolute truth?”Gaganagañja said: “It is not the
place of birth nor the place of death, it is neither a place nor non-place. Such a place
is the place of the absolute truth, and just the place of absolute truth is the place of
all dharmas.The place of all dharmas is not a place, and that which is not a place is without
place because there is no place of birth or place of death, thus it is neither a place
nor non-place. Such is the place of the tathāgata which is not considered as the place of
birth nor the place of cessation.In this way, son of good family, that the tathāgata appears
is an extreme (eko ’ntaḥ) and that the tathāgata never appears is another extreme, thus
you should seek the tathāgata from the middle way (madhyamapratipad) which is free from
both extremes, namely the existence of birth or the non-existence of birth.”Ratnaśrī said:
“Son of good family, although that the buddha arises from the absence of the place of birth
or death is profound, son of good family, who would believe this appearing of the buddha?”Gaganagañja
said: “One who does not make any matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa).”Ratnaśrī
said: “Son of good family, how is ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ explained?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ is a word for imputing (samāropa).One
who does not impute anything to any dharma does not makes any matter of dispute concerning
any dharma, therefore a word for ‘no matter of dispute’ is a word for sameness (samatā);a
word for sameness is a word for the incomparable (asadṛśa);a word for the incomparable
is a word for the absence of words (apada);a word for the absence of words is a word
for the absence of letters (anakṣara);a word for the absence of letters is a word for the
absence of information (avijñapti);a word for the absence of information, in which there
is no activity (apracāra) of thoughts and mind (cittamanas), is a word for the absence of
activity;Just as, even though bird-tracks do not remain in the sky, we still talk about it
with the place of sound, in the same way, whether the buddha is born or unborn, we still
talk about it with the word to be born.In that case, even though the bodhisatva teaches non-origination
(anutpāda), he still makes things appear.Why is that? Because the essential
nature of all dharmas (sarvadharmasvabhāva) is the essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasavabhāva);the
essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasvabhāva) is without own nature (niḥsvabhāva);that
which has no essential nature, in that there is no existence;that in which
there is no existence, that is established nowhere, thus all dharmas are the limit established
nowhere (apratiṣṭhitakoṭi);the limit established nowhere is the limit of all dharmas,
thus all the dharmas are called ‘being established in the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi)’;what
is called the limit of reality is the unlimited limit (aparicchinnakoṭi);since the limit
is in accordance with all limits, all dharmas appear as having attained the limit.Why
is that? Because, even if the limit attains another part of the sky, it is still the same
limit in the sky. Just as there is no border dividing the sky, just so there is no limit
of any dharma (sarvadharmakoṭi) in the limit of reality (bhutakoṭi).Since the limit of reality
is the limit of the self (ātmakoṭi), by knowing the limit of the self, the knowledge
of the limit of all beings is understood.Since the limit of all dharmas is unified with the
limit of all beings, all dharmas are called ‘the limit of exhaustion (kṣaya), the end of
exhaustion, and the ultimate of exhaustion.’What is called ‘exhaustion (kṣaya)’ is a designation
(adhivacana) for extinction (nirvāṇa), and thus all dharmas are the same as extinction.Why
is that? Because it is without adversary (niṣpratipakṣa).Just as there is no adversary
in open space, so there is no adversary in all dharmas.Those who seek extinction (nirvāṇa)
in the perspective of an adversary see birth and death, and those who think that these
dharmas will be born and will die never know the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā)
since they practice in birth and death.Therefore, the Lord said “You should know! you should
know! Do not dispute! Do not dispute! Fulfill the indisputable excellent qualities of
ascetics (śrāmaṇa)!”
