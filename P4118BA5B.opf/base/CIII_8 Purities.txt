Son of good family, there are eight purities of the insight of the bodhisatvas. What are the
eight? (ime kulputra aṣṭaviśuddhayo bodhisatvasya prajñā gaganasamā bhavati. kathame aṣṭau)To
with, a) although they attain all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharmasamudāgamata), they
do not stick to the view of eternity (śāśvatadṛṣṭi);b) although they strive to get rid of
all bad qualities (sarvākuśaladharmaprahāṇavīryārambha), they do not fall into the view
of annihilation (uccheda);c) although they enter into dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśa),
they are not contradictory (virudhyate) with the tolerance that all things are
unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti);d) although they illuminate four kinds of special knowledge
(catasraḥ pratisaṃvida), they are not attached to interpretation and eloquence (niruktipratibhāna);e)
although they teach four summaries of the dharma (dharmoddāna), they never
see anything (na samanupaśyanti) in impermanence, suffering, selfless, or quiescence (anityaduḥkhānātmaśānta);f)
although they teach to enter into action and duties (karmakāryāvatāra),
they are free from karmic result (vipāka) and also not disturbed by performing deeds
(karmakāra);g) although they are established in the knowledge of teachings (dharmajñāna)
which is beyond discursive thinking (niṣprapañca), they elucidate the division of words
of all teachings (sarvadharmapadaprabheda);h) they attain the illumination of all teachings
(sarvadharmāloka) and teach living beings about impurity and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna).Those
eight are, son of good family, the pure insights of the bodhisatvas.
