Śakrabrahmalokapāla

When that prophecy (vyākaraṇa) of the wicked Māra was set forth, all the assembly of Indras,
Brahmās and Lokapālas were astonished (āścaryaprāpta), and uttered a joyous utterance (udānam
udānayati): “Even though they have done that many works of the Māra, they still can produce
the thought of incomparable complete awakening by means of meaningfulness of seeing
the tathāgata (tathāgatāmoghadarśana). The discipline of the dharma (dharmavinaya), which
is well spoken (svākhyāta) by the Lord, is marvelous!O Lord, who is the son or daughter of
good family (kulaputrā vā kuladuhitaro vā) who could measure (pramātṛ-) the buddha-fields
(buddhakṣetra) from one person to another (pudgalena pudgalaḥ) because it cannot be measured
by any disciple or isolated buddha?”The Lord said: “So it is, friends. The sphere of
the buddha is just like what you said.However, friends, their thoughts are dependently originated,
and I see living beings who walks with desire and who stops without desire, who wears
a dharma-robe being full of impurities (saṃkleśa) and who puts on the robe without impurities
(kleśa), and who eats porridge out of greed and who stops it without appetite. O
friends, the types of behavior of living beings are so diverse.Since there are living beings
who strive for [the buddha’s] words by understanding a condensed statement (udghaṭitajñā)
or by understanding a full, detailed explanations (vipañcitajña), the tathāgata gives them
the discourses of teaching the dharma, accordingly to each individual (yathāpratyarhadharmāvatāraṇanirdeśa).O
friends, vices are neither established in place nor direction, and
they are neither a collection nor accumulated things.Vices arise superficially (ayoniśas)
but purity arises in the fundamental way (yoniśas). In that way, if you investigate the arising
of vices fundamentally, then they arise as purity.It is therefore, with this in mind,
said that, when one knows wrong views (mithyādṛṣṭi) as wrong views, namely as they really
are (yathābhūta), he will have right views (samyagdṛṣṭi).Wrong views would never be right
views, would never not be right views, would never be separated from right views. However,
if one, after having known wrong views as wrong views, is not established in them without
any action or effort, then he will enter into the way of right views, thus this is called
the right view (samyagdṛṣṭi).O friends, vices are the darkness but the purity is the light.
Vices are of weak power but the expanded vision is powerful. Vices are accidental but
its essential nature is of pure root. Vices are false imaginations but its essential nature
is the absence of false imagination (kavir1 mārṣā kleśāḥ | āloko viśuddhiḥ | durbalāḥ

is like this, friends, this great earth is based on water, water is
supported by wind, wind is founded on space, but space is dependent on nothing. Thus, among
these four elements, namely earth, water, wind, and space, space is more powerful and firmer
than any of the other elements, and is not accumulated. Since it is not accumulated,
it is neither originated nor destroyed and is stable with its own essence (tad yathā mārṣā

the contrary,] these three elements [namely, earth, water,
and wind] are endowed with origination and destruction, unstable and of no long duration.
It is perceived that these are changeable, but space is by no means changeable (tatra

that way, the parts of personality, spheres and fields of perception have
their basis in the actions and vices. The actions and vices have their basis in the superficial
mental effort. The superficial mental effort has its basis in the purity of original
nature. Therefore, it is said that the thought is basically pure but it is sullied by the
occasional vices (evam eva skandhadhātvāyatanāni karmakleśapratiṣṭhitāni | karmakleśā ayoniśomanaskārapratiṣṭhitāḥ

the superficial mental effort, the actions and vices,
and the parts of personality, spheres and fields of perception, all of them are originated
from the combinations of causes and conditions. When causes and conditions are not combined,
they are extinguished. But their original nature is of no cause nor condition. Consequently,
they are never combined. Thus there is no origination nor destruction of it. (tatra

essential nature is like space, the superficial mental
effort is like wind, the actions and vices are like water, and the parts of personality,
spheres and fields of perception are like earth. Therefore, it is said that all dharmas
are devoid of any root, the root which is established in nothing, the root of purity, and
the root of no root (tatra yathākāśadhātus tathā prakṛtiḥ | yathā vāyudhātus tathāyoniśomanasikāraḥ

friends, since this is the gate into the light of the dharma (dharmālokamukha)
called Prakṛtiviśuddhimukha, the bodhisatvas, having enter into it, are not established
in the gate of any vice (sarvakleśamukha) and not proud of any pure gate as well.Since all
of them destroy haughtiness, they penetrate the suitable way (sārūpyagāminī pratipad) and
transcend all sphere of the Māra.Since they transcend the sphere of the Māra, they are
established in the sphere of the buddha.Since they are established in the sphere of the buddha,
they enter into the sphere of all beings.Since they enter into the sphere of all beings,
they do not agitate the sphere of the absolute truth (dharmadhātu).Since they are in
accordance with the sphere of the absolute truth, they obtain the omniscience (sarvajñajñāna)
by obtaining sameness and no distinction (samanirviśeṣatā).When the teaching was taught,
many bodhisatvas became free from all manifestations of mental disturbance (sarvakaukṛtyaparyutthāna),
manifestation of the hindrances [to obtain] the dharma (dharmāvaraṇaparyutthāna),
and the actions and vices (karmakleśa), and then attained the tolerance that all things
are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti).
