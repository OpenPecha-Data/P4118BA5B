12. ŚīlānusmṛtiSon of good family, how does the recollection of morality of bodhisatva becomes
like open space (tatra kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā śīlānusmṛtir gaganasamā)?.What
we called ‘morality (śīla)’ is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), unsullied (anāsrava),
no wishful thinking (apraṇidhāna), effortless (anābhoga), and it accomplishes vows (siddhavrata),
fulfils the vows (vrataparipūri), and does not have essential characteristic of
information (vijñaptilakṣaṇa).Since it is established by concentration (samādhi), it is not
established in the object of thought (cittopalaṃbha).Since it is the root of insight (prajñāmūla),
it is without essential characteristic of discursive thinking (niḥprapañcalakṣaṇa).Since
it is the outcome of liberation (vimuktiniṣyanda), it is not distinguished by duality
(advayaprabhāvita).Since there is no visual form, it is praised by the wise (pāṇḍitapraśaṃsita).Since
it appeases vices (kleśapraśamana), there is no essential characteristic
of recognition (aprativijñaptilakṣaṇa).Since it is in accordance with all happiness (sarvasukhānugata)
and is not generated by the contrary (pratipakṣaprabhāvita), while recollecting
this morality, there is no impurity (anāvila) in the recollection. Son of good family,
this is what is called the recollection of morality which is authorized by the Lord (sa kulaputra
bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā śīlānusmṛtiḥ).
