Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the supramundane
path (lokottaramārga) of the bodhisatvas, the great beings?”At these words, the Lord
replied to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:Son of good family, what is called the supramundane
path (lokottaramārga) is the six perfections (ṣaṭpāramitā), thirty-seven dharmas which are
the wings of awakening (saptatriṃśadbodhipakṣikadharma), peaceful meditation (śamatha), expanded
vision (vipaśyana), four means of attraction (catvāri saṃgrahavastūni), four meditaions
(catvāri dhyānāni), four immeasurables (catvāry apramāṇāni), four formless states of
meditation (catasra ārūpyasamāpattaya), and five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā). Son
of good family, this is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.The world (loka) is the
five parts of the personality (pañcaskandha).Thus, having known that the form (rūpa) is impermanent
(anitya), suffering (duḥkha), selfless (anātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya),
without distinguishing marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta),
unborn, unproduced, dependently originated, isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya),
without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like an illusion (māyā), like a dream (svapna), like
a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water (udakacandra), like an echo (pratiśrutkā),
like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected image (pratibimba), and like grass,
trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), the bodhisatva
gives a gift, and enters into the suchness of giving (dānatathatā) through the suchness of
form (rūpatathatā).Then he understands the suchness of transforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through
the suchness of giving (dānatathatā), the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā) through
the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā) through the
suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living
being, and the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness of the
self. This the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is
not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son
of good family, because he gives a gift by understanding suchness, this giving is the supramundane
path (lokottaramārga) of bodhisatvas.In the same way, having known that the feeling,
perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent,
the bodhisatva gives a gift.Having known that the consciousness (vijñāna) is suffering
(duḥkha), selfless (anātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing
marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unborn, unproduced,
and dependently originated, he gives a gift.Having known that the consciousness (vijñāna)
is isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like
an illusion (māyā), like a dream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected
in water (udakacandra), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected image (pratibimba),
and has the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), he gives a gift,
and thus understands the suchness of giving through the suchness of consciousness.Then he
understands the suchness of transforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of giving
(dānatathatā), the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā) through the suchness of transforming,
the suchness of living being (satvatathatā) through the suchness of awakening, the
suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living being, and the suchness
of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness of the self. This the suchness of
all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness
(avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, since the
bodhisatva gives a gift by understanding suchness, this giving is the supramudane path (lokottaramārga)
of bodhisatva.Again, son of good family, the bodhisatva, having known that
the form (form) is impermanent (anitya), having protected the morality, etc., and having known
that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa),
preserves the morality (śīlaṃ rakṣ-).Then he understands the suchness of morality
(śīlatathatā) through the suchness of form (rūpatathatā), the suchness of transforming
(pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of morality, the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā)
through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā)
through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness
of living being, and the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness
of the self.The suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness,
is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā).
Since he understands the suchness, son of good family, this protecting the morality is
the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.In the same way, the bodhisatva, having known that
the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are impermanent, having protected the morality, etc., and having known the character of
being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), protects the morality, and then understands
the suchness of morality (śīlatathatā) through the suchness of consciousness (vijñānatathatā).He
understands the suchness of transforming through the suchness of morality, the suchness
of awakening through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being through
the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness of living being,
and the suchness of all dharmas through the suchness of the self. This suchness of all
dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā),
and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Since the bodhisatva understands suchness,
this protecting the morality is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.Again, son
of good family, the bodhistva, having known that the form (rūpa) is impermanent, practices
patience (kṣānti), makes a vigorous effort (vīryam ārabh-) according to what he understands,
concentrates on meditation (dhyāna), and investigates insight (prajñā). Then he, having
known that from the form is impermanent to the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths,
and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), investigates insight.The bodhisatva understands
the suchness of insight through the suchness of form, the suchness of transforming
through the suchness of insight, the suchness of awakening through the suchness of transforming,
the suchness of living beings through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of
the self through the suchness of living beings, the suchness of all dharmas through the suchness
of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness,
is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā).
Son of good family, since he understands the suchness, this preserving the morality
is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.In that way, the bodhisatva, having known that
the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna)
are impermanent, having investigated the insight, etc., and having known the character of
being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), investigates the insight. Then he understands
the suchness of insight (prajñātathatā) through the suchness of consciousness (vijñānatathatā),
the suchness of transforming through the suchness of insight, the suchness of awakening
through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living beings through the suchness
of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness of living beings, the suchness
of all dharmas through the suchness of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā)
is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and
nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, since he understands the suchness,
this investigating the insight is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.Furthermore,
son of good family, the bodhisatva, having known that the form is impermanent, having cultivated
the application of awareness concerned with body (kāye kāyānupaśyanā smṛtyupasthānam),
etc., having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections
(tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), cultivates the application of awareness concerned with
body.The bodhisatva understands the suchness of body (kāyatathatā) through the suchness of
form (rūpatathatā), and understands from the suchness of body to the suchness of all dharmas.
This suchness of all dharmas is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness,
and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he cultivates the application
of awareness concerned with body, and thus, son of good family, this absence of thought-constructions
(nirvikalpa) through the thought-construction connected with body is the
supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.In the same way, having known that the feeling, perception,
formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent,
just as the bodhisatva gives a gift more and more, he expands his feelings, thoughts and
dharmas (vedanācittadharma). Thus he, having known that the form is impermanent, having practiced
the application of awareness which consists in considering the dharma (dharme dharmānupaśyanā
smṛtyupasthānam), etc., having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls,
paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), applies himself to the awareness
which consists in considering the dharma.Thus, he, having known that the feeling, perception,
formative factors and consciousness is impermanent, having practiced the application
of awareness which consists in considering the dharma, etc., having known the character
of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), applies himself to the awareness which consists
in considering the dharma.In that way, what is the suchness of the parts of the personality
(skandhatathatā) is the suchness of the application of awareness (smṛtyupasthānatathatā).
What is the suchness of the application of awareness is the suchness of transforming.
What is the suchness of transforming is the suchness of awakening. What is the suchness
of awakening is the suchness of living beings. What is the suchness of living beings is
the suchness of the self. What is the suchness of the self is the suchness of all dharmas.
What is the suchness of all dharmas is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness,
and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he applies himself to
the awareness concerned with the dharma, he does not make any thought-construction through
the thought-constructions connected with the dharma, and thus such understanding is the
supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.And so on, just as the bodhisatva develops the application
of awareness (smṛtyupasthāna), in the same way, he develops correct elimination (samyakprahāṇa),
the base of magical power (ṛddhipāda), sense organs (indriya), power (bala), the
limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), path (mārga), peaceful meditation (śamatha), expanded vision
(vipaśyana), four means of attraction (catvāri saṃgrahavastūni), four meditaions (catvāri
dhyānāni), four immeasurables (catvāry apramāṇāni), four formless states of meditation
(catasra ārūpyasamāpattaya), five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā).Then, since the
bodhisatva attains the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna) after having known
that the form is impermanent, he, having known that the form is suffering (duḥkha), selfless
(anātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing marks (animitta),
wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unborn, dependently originated, isolated,
cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like an illusion
(māyā), like a dream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water
(udakacandra), like an echo (pratiśrutkā), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected
image (pratibimba), and like grass, trees, walls, paths and reflection (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa),
accomplishes the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna).In
that way, he accomplishes the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna) after having
known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness are impermanent.
Then he, having known the consciousness (vijñāna) is suffering, selfless, tranquil, empty,
without distinguishing marks, wishless, unconditioned, unborn, unproduced, dependently
originated, isolated, cannot be grasped, without basis, unborn, like an illusion, like a
dream, like a mirage, like the moon reflected in water, like an echo, like a reflection,
like a reflected image, and has the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa),
accomplishes supernatural knowledges.To wit, what is the suchness of the parts of the
personality (skandhatathatā) that is the suchness of supernormal knowledges (abhijñātathatā).
What is the suchness of supernormal knowledges that is the suchness of transforming. What
is the suchness of transforming that is the suchness of awakening. What is the suchness
of awakening that is the suchness of living beings. What is the suchness of living beings
that is the suchness of the self. What is the suchness of the self that is the suchness
of all dharmas. What is the suchness of all dharmas that is the absence of suchness, is not
different from suchness, and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he
accomplishes the knowledge of supernormal knowledges (abhijñājñāna), and thus such understanding
is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.Why is that? The supramunane path is
to understand the suchness of form, thus the form is indestructible, uninterrupted, permanent,
dependently originated, and non-origination by its own nature (svabhāvenānutpanna).In
the same way, the bodhisatva understands the suchness of feeling, perception, formative factors
and consciousness, thus consciousness is indestructible, uninterrupted, permanent,
dependently originated, and non-origination by its own nature (svabhāvānutpatti).Transcending
the world of the parts of personality (skandhaloka) is not to be attached to the world
of form or the world without form, but to teach for living beings in the five state of existence
(pañcagatyupapanna) to transcend the world, thus he teaches in that way but does not
destroy the world.Why is that? Because the essential character (lakṣaṇa) that the world
is impermanent is not destroyed. The world is essentially characterized by from suffering,
selflessness, peace, emptiness, non-distinguishing mark, wishlessness, the unconditioned,
to suchness, thus this impermanent world is, son of good family, the pure supramunane path
of the bodhisatvas.The bodhisatva established on the pure path (mārgapariśuddhipratiṣṭhita)
produces the great light of the dharma (mahāntaṃ dharmāvabhāsaṃ karoti) for the sake
of living beings who are on the wrong path.Then those living beings, having attained the light,
are also established in the true supramunane path.This path is the most excellent since
it is for the sake of the obtainment of the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa);this path
is excellent since it is without any bad thought (sarvākuśalacitta);this path is the best
since it is to attain the summit (mūrdhan) for the sake of the knowledge of the buddha (buddhajñāna);this
path is unsurpassed since it releases [living beings] from all the stream
of existence (sarvaughottaraṇa);this path is unexcelled since it transcends all limited paths
(sarvaprādeśikamārga);this path is incomparable since there is no concept of contrary
(pratipakṣānupalambha);this path is unequalled (asamasama) since it is reciting (saṃgīti)
the path of the previous buddhas (pūrvabuddha);this path leads to happiness since it vanquishes
any Māra or adversary (nihatasarvamārapratyarthika);this path leads to no hindrance
since it is the miraculous play (vikrīḍita) by knowing supernormal knowledges (abhijñā) and
the base of magical power (ṛddhipāda);this path is without darkness (tamo’ndhakāra) since
it is completely pure radiance by insight (prajñā);this path is righteous since it is without
deception or guile (māyāśāṭhya);this path is luminous since there is no crooked thinking
(akuṭilacitta);this path is impartial since it has the equal attitude to all living beings
(sarvasatvasamacittatā);this path is vast (vipula) since it is open to all living beings
(sarvasatvāvakāśa);this path is wide since there is no conflict between one another;this
path is in the state of tranquility since it leads to the unbornness (anutpāda);this path
is firm with merits (puṇya) because of the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā);this
path is without affliction (saṃtāpa) because of the perfection of morality (śīlapāramitā);this
path is indestructible because of the perfection of forbearance (kṣāntipāramitā);this
path can not be repulsed (avivārya) because of the perfection of vigour (vīryapāramitā);this
path is free from any impurity (sarvarajavigata) because of the perfection of meditation
(dhyānapāramitā);this path leads to the sameness of open space (gaganasamatā) because
of the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā);this path is in accordance with knowledge (jñānānugamana)
since it is without conceit (nirmānatā);this path is in accordance with cultivating
all qualities of the buddha (sarvadharmaparibhāvana) since all good qualities are
fully accomplished (sarvakuśaladharmasamudānīta).this path is in accordance with one who
turns the wheel of the dharma (dharmacakrapravartanānugamana) since it keeps what has been
taught before (pūrvāvisaṃvādanatā).Since those are the pure supramunane path of the bodhisatvas,
son of good family, having been established in this pure path, the bodhisatva, wearing
the great armour (mahāsaṃnāha), rides in this great vehicle (mahāyāna) and proceeds to
the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa).
