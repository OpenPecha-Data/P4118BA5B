Kutūhalajāta

At that time, the bodhisatva, the great being Kutūhalajāta came and sat down in this assembly,
addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, thinking about where this sound [of the dharma
(dharmaśabda)] is coming from (niścar-), I am absolutely astonished (āścaryaprāpta).”The Lord
said: “Son of good family, you should ask the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, and he will answer
to you.”The bodhisatva Kutūhalajāta said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family,
I am absolutely astonished (kutūhalajāta), thinking about where this sound [of the dharma
(dharmaśabda)] is coming from.”Gaganagañja said: “What do you think, son of good family
(tat kiṃ manyase kulaputra)? Where is an echo (pratiśrutkā)coming from?”Kutūhalajāta said:
“Son of good family, the sound of an echo comes from the sound uttered by another person
(paraśabdavijñapti).”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, does an echo (pratiśrutkā)
have body, thought, form, color, or shape (kāyacittarūpavarṇasaṃsthāna)?Kutūhalajāta said:
“No, son of good family.”Gaganagañja said: “Quite so, son of good family. Just as an echo
does not really exist (apariniṣpanna) and it is merely the perception of sounds (śabdasaṃprāpaṇa),
in the same way, [the sound of the dharma coming from] open space does not really
exist and it is also the perception of sounds.”Kutūhalajāta said: “Son of good family,
who perceives this sound? where is this sound coming from?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good
family, the recognition of knowledge (jñānaprativijñapti) is incomprehensible. Even though
we think that it is coming from this open space because of the reflection of our mind, it
is neither going nor coming. The resonance of sound is just coming.Son of good family, you
should examine its profoundness (gaṃbhīra) in the perspective of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda).Even
though the result arises from the causes, the causes is not transferred
to the attainment of fruits (phalodaya), but when there is no cause, there is no arising
of result.That is to say, this dharma is produced as a result (phala) from causes and
conditions (hetupratyaya), but even so there is no activity (āniṃjya) nor agent (kāraka)
in them.Those who perceive things thus are beyond the fruition of causes (visāmagrī).Why is
that? This is because the Lord said that understanding defilements (saṃkleśa) is purification
(vyavadāna); suppressing defilements (saṃkleśasaṃghāta) is not purification as the essential
character (svabhāvalakṣaṇa) of defilement is purification.In fact, both defilement
and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna) are just conventional expressions (saṃketapada).Defilement
and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna) are not apprehended within the limit of the ultimate
truth (paramārthakoṭi).Since the limit of the ultimate truth is beyond limit (akoṭi),
that which is beyond limit is the true limit (bhūtakoṭi).The true limit (bhūtakoṭi) is
the limit of emptiness (śūnyatākoṭi).The the limit of emptiness (śūnyatākoṭi) is the limit
of the self (ātmakoṭi).The limit of the self is the limit of all dharmas (sarvadharmakoṭi).Why
is that? Concerning all dharmas, the limit of them, the limit of emptiness, and the
limit of tranquility; being unattached to the gate into these three limits is attaining the
unattached knowledge to any dharma.Then Śāriputra the Elder addressed himself to the bodhisatva
Kutūhalajāta: “Son of good family, why are you called Kutūhalajāta?”Kutūhalajāta
said: “Venerable Śāriputra, wherever you have wished and struggled for the dharma, have you
wondered about it?”Śāriputra said: “Quite so, son of good family.”Kutūhalajāta said: “In
the same way, Venerable Śāriputra, I have wished and struggled for all dharmas here and there,
but I still wonder about when I can fulfill all the qualities of the buddha. That is
why I am called Kutūhalajāta.I wonder about all practices of the bodhisatva (sarvabodhisatvacaryā)
and the knowledge of entering into the thoughts and deeds of all living beings (sarvasatvacittacaritāpraveśajñāna).
That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.What I wonder about
is without any knowledge or any entrance. That is way I called Kutūhalajāta.That on which
I wonder about is without weak point (avatāra) concerning any vice (sarvakleśa) or any
work of Māra (sarvamārakarma). That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.”Then the Śāriputra the
Elder addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, even though this name of good person proclaims
and teaches all dharmas of the buddha, he is not attached to any dharma of the buddha.
It is a wonderful to teach all dharmas of the buddha without any attachment.”
