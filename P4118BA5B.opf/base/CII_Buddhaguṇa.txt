If, Lord, the Tathāgata gives (pravārayatu) some advice (kathā) about the entrance into the
analysis of the dharma (dharmaviniścaya) to me, I would ask a question.Why is that (tat kasya
hetoḥ)? The Lord, having obtained the knowledge of non-attachment (asaṅga), is skilled
in knowing the excellent and not so excellent abilities in all living beings (sarvasatvavarāvarendriyajñānakuśala);The
Lord, having obtained the light, is free from the all darkness
(sarvāndhakāravigata);The Lord, having known the meaning (arthajña), is skilled in the
knowledge of the division of words (padaprabhedajñāna);The Lord, having known the proper time
(kālajña), is always free of faulty prophecy (akṣūṇavyākaraṇa);The Lord, having known
the proper measure (mātrakāla), teaches religion accordingly to each individual (yathāpratyarhadharmadeśaka)
of all living being;The Lord, having played with (vikrīḍita) the supernormal
knowledges (abhijñā), is skilled in the knowledge of ascertainment (viniścaya) of the
base of magic (ṛddhipāda);The Lord, having been endowed with the understanding of observation
(vyavalokanabuddhimat), throughly shows (ādarśita) the mental behavior of all living
beings (sarvasatvacittacarita) as he places it upon the palm of his hand (karatale);Since
the Lord has been elevated above (abhyudgata), nobody can look at the top of his head (anavalokitamūrdhatā);The
Lord, having been unsurpassed (anabhibhūta), became a hero in the great
three-thousand thousands of worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu);The Lord, having
awakened through his own power (svayaṃbhū), entered into the state of perfect awakening (abhisaṃbuddha)
by himself (svayam) to the all moments of existence without a teacher (anācāryakam);The
Lord is the leader (nāyaka), and teaches the right way (samyagmārgadeśika) to
those on bad ways (kumārgapratipanneṣu) without any leader (anāyaka);The Lord, having become
the king of doctors (vaidyarāja), establishes (pratiṣṭhāpayati) the way into the state
without disease (vyādhi) or death (maraṇa) for [living beings] who are involved with this
world (lokasanniveśa) covered with desire, defilement, and obstruction (āvaraṇa) from beginningless
until endless time (anavarāgra);The Lord, having had power and vitality (sthāmaparākrama),
is skilled in the knowledge if what is proper and what is improper (sthānāsthānajñānakuśala),
and has obtained the three knowledges (trividya);The Lord has obtained intrepidities
(vaiśāradya), extinguished contamination (āsravakṣaya), was perfectly awakened to
(abhisaṃbuddha) sameness (samatā), is skilled in the knowledge of purification (vyavadāna)
without affliction (asaṃkliṣṭa), and roars the best of lions’ roar (siṃharṣabhanādanādi)
to all of the world including the gods;The Lord, having been endowed with the eighteen special
qualities of the Buddha (āveṇikabuddhadharmasamanvāgata), has the unattached knowledge
(asaṅgajñāna) of the three times (trikāla);The Lord, having purified his body, speech,
and mind (kāyavakcittapariśuddhi), has neither error (skhalita) nor rough speech (ravita),
and sees every concentration (samāpatti) and the knowledge of liberation (vimuktijñānadarśana);The
Lord, who lives with great friendliness (mahāmaitrī), has a mind without hostile
intent (apratihata) and same thoughts towards all living beings (samacittatā sarvasatveṣu)
because he is endowed with the [divine] sight (cakṣur) which is to see with the light of
the same nature as empty space (gaganasama);The Lord, who is established in great compassion
(mahākaruṇā), is not shaken by good, evil, pain, or pleasure (sukṛtaduṣkṛtasukhaduḥkha)
of living beings because he is endowed with the mind which is the entrance into the sameness
(samatā);The Lord, who is equal to all the buddhas (sarvabuddhasama), enters into the
non-duality which is the knowing of the equality (dvayasamatājñānapraviṣṭa);The Lord, who
is without distinction (nirviśeṣa), practices (prayoga) sameness (samatā) of all living
beings since he is purified (suviśuddha) just like empty space;The Lord is free from desire,
is satisfied with insight (prajñatṛpta), and free from gain, honor and fame (lābhasatkāraśloka);The
Lord is omniscient (sarvajña), and his mode of five eyes (pañcacakṣur) is purified
(pariśuddhi) and sees everything;I, having known that the Lord is endowed with such
immeasurable virtues, religion, and knowledge of the tathāgata (apramāṇatathāgataguṇadharmajñāna),
have a high regard for them, and wish to respectfully (sagaurava) ask you the entrance
into the explaining of religion (dharmaprabhāvanapraveśa).Living beings should practice
the religion without pride (nirmāṇatā), and ask the Tathāgata for the sake of desire to
realize the religion by the knowledge of omniscience (sarvajñajñānābhinirhāra).This had
been said, the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (evam ukte bhagavān
gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ mahāsatvam etad avocat):“Good, good (sādhu sādhu), son of
good family (kulaputra). You asked so many Awakened Lords as numerous as the grains of sand
in the river Gaṅgā (aṅgānadīvālikāsama) and attained the prophecy of awakening (vyākaraṇalābha).
Son of good family, ask the Tathāgata whatever you may wish. I will satisfy your
mind (cittam ārādhayiṣyāmi) by prophecy.”Then the bodhisatva, the great being named Guṇarājaprabhāsa
joined this assembly, was seated with them, , and said this to the bodhisatva,
the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu guṇarājaprabhāso nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tatraiva
pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt sanniṣaṇṇo gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ etad avocat).“Son of good
family, why do you wish to pose a question to the Tathāgata?” Then again, the bodhisatva,
the great being Gaganagañja uttered these verses to that bodhisatva, the great being Guṇarājaprabhāsa.
