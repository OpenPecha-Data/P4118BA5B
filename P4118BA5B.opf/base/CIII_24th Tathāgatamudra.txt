24. TathāgatamudrāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva become skilled in knowing
suchness without any differentiation (tathatāvinirbhāgajñānakuśala) as sealed with the seal
of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita)?With regard to what we called ‘being sealed with
the seal of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita),’ suchness without any differentiation
(tathatāvinirbhāga) is the seal, and it is without distinction, activity (apravṛtti), attachment
(abhiniveśa), agitating, or being agitated, and thus it cannot be shaken (na kampayituṃ
śakyate) by the world with its gods, humans, or anti-gods (sadevamānuṣāsureṇa lokena).Why?
The world with its gods, humans and anti-gods is indeed sealed with that seal,and
the seal of the tathāgata is the seal which is unoriginated, empty (śūnyatā), signless (animitta),
wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), free from desire (virāga), just
as it is (tathatā), the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), and open space (gagana).Just as the
seal in the empty space (gaganamudrā) does not appear, the seal of the tathāgata does not
appear to even the five kinds of sight as it is sealed by the seal having its own essential
character (svalakṣaṇamudrāmudrita).All the explanations about the dharma and the pertaining
conventions (dharmavyavahāra) given by the tathāgata are sealed with the seal of the
tathāgata in that way.Among them, those which pertain to the sphere of consciousness establish
the dharma;but those which are not established in consciousness do not establish any
dharma, and do not differentiate between any dharma;those which are sealed with the seal
of the tathāgata do not differentiate suchness (tathatā).What then is the differentiation
of suchness (nānātathatā)?It is those which differentiate (kalpayanti) the dharmas of superior,
mediocre, and inferior (hīnamadhyaviśiṣṭa),those, which do not construct any dharma
and do not make any differentiation, do not differentiate suchness,and, no matter how many
things are imagined and constructed (kalpitavikalpita), they do not differentiate suchness.Just
like all living beings wander about in empty space, the sphere of empty space (gaganadhātu)
is not connected with them, in that way, all living beings wander about in suchness,
but they do not tarnish suchness.And here, the bodhisatva who can understand such dharmas
is sealed with the seal of the tathāgata, and he does not tarnish suchness.
