Son of good family, there are eighty1 ways into those concentrations (samādhimukha), and again
each of them has five hundred gates into concentrations;adding all of them together, those
will be forty thousand concentrations, and thus those will be eighty thousand concentrations
counting impurity and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna);those will be eighty-four thousand
concentrations of knowing the imperishability (akṣayatā) in the past, future, and present.As
many as are concentrations, so many are ways into the dharma (dharmamukha), and
so many are masses of religious teachings (dharmaskandha). Thus it is said that the Tathāgata
explained eighty-four thousand masses of religious teachings (caturaśītidharmaskandhasahasra)
for the sake of entering into the eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour of living
beings.This is, son of good family, the summary of the dharma (dharmoddāna) for all beings
to know the entrance into the knowledge and practices of the buddha (buddhajñānapracārapraveśa).Since
that which is entering into all knowledge of the buddha and all behaviour of
living beings is immeasurable and inconceivable, even if your life were to last eight thousand
aeons, it would not be easy to express.When this knowledge of the buddha was taught
and those gates into concentrations were explained, sixteen thousand bodhisatvas attained
the tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti), which is brought about
through the knowledge and concentrations (samādhijñānābhinirhṛta).Eighty-four thousand sons
of gods produced the thought of incomparable complete awakening (caturaśītisahasradevaputrā
anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpādayanti).Then the Lord applauded the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjāya bodhisatvāya sādhukāram adāt):“Good man
(satpuruṣa), the teaching of this gate into concentration (samādhimukha) was well spoken
(subhāṣita) by you. Just as the dharmas are not dependent on others (aparapratyaya) because
they are directly perceived by [the senses] of your body (kāyapratyakṣa), in the same way
the knowledge of the tathāgata was elucidated - this complete teaching is good, very good.”
