Son of good family, the bodhisatva transcends the Māra inherent in the parts of personality
(skandhamārasamatikrānta) by knowing and understanding the fact that all dharmas are just
like an illusion (sarvadharmamāyopama);he transcends the Māra of vices (kleśamārasamatikrānta)
by correctly understanding in accordance with tradition (yathāśrutadharmeṣu yoniśaḥ prativedhana);he
transcends the Māra of death (mṛtyumārasamatikrānta) by understanding the
dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādaprativedhana);he transcends the Māra of the sons of
gods (devaputramārasamatikrānta) by not forgetting the thought of awakening (bodhicittāsaṃpramoṣa).
