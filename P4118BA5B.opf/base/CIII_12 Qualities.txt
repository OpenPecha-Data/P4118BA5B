When the bodhisatva is endowed with twelve dharmas1 , son of good family, he attains the mastery
in the arising of birth and death. What are the twelve?To wit, (a) he avoids bad friends
(pāpamitraparivarjana) and serves spiritual friends (nityakalyāṇamitrasevana);(b) he completely
purifies erroneous view-points (dṛṣṭisupariśuddha);(c) he purifies the mass of moral
discipline which is authorized by the Buddha (buddhānujñātaśīlaskandhapariśuddha);(d)
he knows the entrance into concentration (samādhisamāpatti);(e) he unifies insight and skillful
means (prajñopāyayuganaddha);(f) he attains unhindered supernormal knowledge (acyutābhijñāprāpaṇatā);(g)
he reflects on non-origination and non-existence (anutpannāsaṃbhūtapratyavekṣaṇā);(h)
he is born according to his will (saṃcintyopapatti) and fulfills his vows
(praṇidhānaparipūraṇa);(i) he applies himself to the friendliness when it concerns the viewpoint
of living beings(satvadṛṣṭimatrīprayoga);(j) he reflects on great compassion (mahākaruṇanidhyāpti),
seeing that the dharmas are just illusionary construct (dharmamāyopamapratyavekṣaṇātayā);(k)
he transmigrates and comes into existence, seeing the absence of birth
and death (cyutyupapatti);(l) he enters into the dharma by its dream-like nature, seeing
the essential character of the dharma (dharmalakṣanasvapnatayā svabhāvadharmapraveśa);(m)
he perceives the inverted dharmas (viparyāsadharma) as they really are (yathābhūtapratyavekṣaṇātayā);(n)
he never cares about the arising of birth and death in transmigration and
manifestation since he is born from the presence of the Awakened Lords.Son of good family,
the bodhisatva, wherever he was born in previous births, revealed himself for the benefit
of living beings; and all those immeasurable and incalculable previous births were established
in two roots (mūladvaya), to wit, the knowledge of supernatural powers (abhijñājñāna)
and the root of great compassion (mahākaruṇāmūla).In that way, son of good family, the
bodhisatva obtains the mastery in the arising of birth and death.

31. MāraHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva transcend the way of the four Māras
(caturmārapathasamatikrānta) and vanquish all Māras and adversaries (sarvamārapratyarthika)?
