Ānanda

At that time, the venerable Ānanda addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu āyuṣman ānando
bhagavantam etad avocat):“It is a marvelous thing, Lord, just as the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
manifests his body, just so he teaches us.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda,
my body is manifested though, it is not manifested by myself.Why is that? Because open
space is my body, it is manifested.”Ānanda said: “How then is your body manifested?”Gaganagañja
said: “This is because, even though the buddha’s work (buddhakṛtya) is done by the
body, the true body (dharmakāya), which is not undefiled, is not brought about through
the parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana), nor born
of the inverted body (viparyayakāya), but obtained by the mental body (manaskāya). In this
way, the bodhisatva’s body is manifested.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, are you manifesting
all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda, one should not think of my body separated
from the dharma, it is the dharma itself, and the dharma itself is my body, in this
way I manifest my body.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, if you manifested your body,
are you an Arhat?”Gaganagañja said: “Having penetrated the entrance into the dharma which
is free from impurity (araṇādharmamukhaprativedha), without desire (rāga), I do not have any
aversion or bewilderment (dveṣamoha), thus I am an Arhat.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family,
if you are a Worthy One, when did you reach complete extinction (parinirvāṇa)?”Gaganagañja
said: “Venerable Ānanda, an Arhat does not reach extinction, and ordinary people (pṛthagjanā)
are not Arhats who reach extinction.Why is that? Because an Arhat gives up the concept
of extinction (nirvāṇasaṃjñā).Since ordinary people just produce the thought-constructions
of extinction, to the extent that they made thought-constructions do they reach extinction.”Ānanda
said: “According to our interpretation of what you said, son of good family,
you are not an Arhat, ordinary man (pṛthagjana), one who is undergoing training (śaikṣa),
one who no longer needs training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tathāgata.”Gaganagañja
said: “Good, Ānanda, very good. Even though the bodhisatva, who is not an Arhat,
ordinary man (pṛthagjana), one who is undergoing training (śaikṣa), one who no longer needs
training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tathāgata, teaches every stage (sarvabhūmi),
he is still not established in any place.”When this teaching was declared, in order
to protect the dharma, five hundred disciples, immediately offering dharma-robes to the
bodhisatva Gaganagañja, said: “May all living beings attain eloquence such as this (sarvasatvā
īdṛśasya pratibhānasya lābhino bhavantu)!”Then, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja, the dharma-robes disappeared into open space.Then those monks, the Worthy
Ones, said: “Son of good family, where did the dharma-robes go?”Gaganagañja said: “They
went into the treasury of open space.”Then the Lord smiled (atha khalu bhagavān smitaṃ
prādurakarot), and the venerable Ānanda asked the meaning of smiling: “O Lord, as the tathāgata
does not smile for no reason, what is the reason for smiling?”The Lord said: “Ānanda,
the bodhisatva Gaganagañja received five hundred robes by those five hundred monks, put
them into the treasury of open space, sprinkled on the world-sphere called Kāṣāyadhvaja. In
this way he performed the buddha-activities (buddhakārya) in the buddha-field of the tathāgata
Parvatarāja. Then the religious discourses given by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja arose
from those dharma-robes in the buddha-field, and hundreds koṭis of bodhisatvas attained
the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)] by the teaching of the
dharma.Ānanda, you should see the sphere of supernatural power and knowledge (ṛddhijñānaviṣaya)
of the bodhisatva in order to bring various living beings to maturity (anekaparyāyasatvaparipācana).When
this teaching was taught, the great rain of flowers, which have been
never seen before, shining brilliantly like the radiant sun and moon (candrasūrya), poured
down, and a voice resonated from those flowers: “Having heard this teaching of the bodhisatva
Gaganagñja, those living beings with faith, being sealed with the irreversible seal
(avaivartikamudrā), will be devoted themselves to the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa).”Ānanda
said: “O Lord, where are these flowers coming from?”The Lord said: “Ānanda, the Brahmā
Prabhāvyūha, who reigned over one hundred thousand world-spheres, sprinkled these flowers
in order to worship (pūjākarmaṇa) the bodhisatva Gaganagañja.”Ānanda said: “O Lord, we would
like to see him.”The Lord said: “Just wait a minute, Ānanda, you will see him soon.”
