Then, by the power of the Lord, the Venerable Śāriputra rose from [his seat in] the pavilion,
stood in the space, placed his knees upon the ground (jānumaṇḍala), saluted the Lord with
his hands put together, and addressed himself to the Lord. (atha khalu buddhānubhāvenāyuṣmāñ
śāriputra utthāya kūṭāgārād gagane sthitvā jānumaṇḍalaṃ pṛthivyāṃ pratiṣṭhāpya yena bhagavāṃs
tenāñjaliṃ praṇamya bhagavantam etad avocat)"Except these pavilions found in space,
O Lord, all of the great three-thousands of worlds have changed into space, becoming the
essence of empty space (ākāśasvabhāva) - what does this auspicious sign (pūrvanimitta) portend?"The
Lord said: "Do you see, Śāriputra, these pavilions?" Śāriputra said: "O Lord,
I see them." (bhagavān āyuṣmantaṃ śāriputram āmantrayate sma paśyasi tvaṃ śāriputra imān kūṭāgārān
| āha paśyāmi bhagavan)The Lord said: “Is it possible to know the limit of the praise
(praśaṃsā) of these pavilions?” Śāriputra said: “I cannot understand, O Lord, the limit
of the praise of these pavilions until the end of my life.”The Lord said: “Śāriputra, just
as this whole assembly, having gone to open space, appear to enter into the well-adorned
pavilion, in the same way they enter into the pavilion in the Mahāvyūha universe.”Śāriputra
said, “O Lord, where is the splendor of Mahāvyūha universe (prabhamahāvyūhalokadhātu)?”
The Lord said, “There is, Śāriputra, the universe named Mahāvyūha where it is located in
the eastern direction (pūrvasyān diśi), beyond eight buddha-fields (aṣṭa buddhakṣetrāṇi)
which are filled with dustlike (paramāṇurajas) numerous buddha-fields. There the tathāgata
named Ekaratnavyūha resides, lives, and teaches religion (tatraikaratnavyūha nāma tathāgato
tiṣṭhati dhriyate yāpayati dharmaṃ deśayati)..O Śāriputra, except for the jewel that is
the thought of awakwning (bodhicitta), any other jewels do not appear in the Mahāvyūha universe.That
is why he is called the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha. (tenocyate tathāgata ekaratnavyūha
iti)When the Tathāgata on the lion’s throne (siṃhāsana) taught religion to those bodhisatvas,
he was elevated into the vault of the sky as high as eighty tāla koṭis. So did
the bodhisatvas in the Mahāvhūya pavilion.
