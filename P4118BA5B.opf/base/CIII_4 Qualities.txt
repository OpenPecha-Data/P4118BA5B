By the four dharmas, the works of Māras are overcome. What are the four?To with, six perfections
(ṣaṭpāramitā) without forgetting the thought of awakening (bodhicittāsaṃpramoṣa);carefulness
established in faithful effort (śraddhāvīryasthitāpramāda);bringing living beings
to maturity (satvaparipācana), based on skill in means (upāyakauśala);obtaining the true dharma
(saddharmaparigraha), based on the profound guiding principle of dharma (gambhīradharmanaya).Son
of good family, the bodhisatva, applying himself to such dharmas, transcends
the way of the four Māras (caturmārapathasamatikrāntata) and vanquishes all Māras and adversaries
(sarvamārapratyarthika).

32. SatvopajīvyaHow then, son of good family, the bodhisatva, having accumulated immeasurable
merits (aprameyapuṇyopacaya), nourishes all living beings (satvopajīvya)?.Son of good family,
the bodhisatva practices friendliness (matrī) to all living beings;he practices compassion
(karuṇā) to all creatures;he is not attached to anything in particular in his meditations
(dhyāneṣu atanmayavihāritā);he gives away all his possessions to beggars (yācanakeṣu
sarvasvaparityāgatā);his pleasure is imperishable (akṣayabhoga) through his merits (puṇya);he
is always committed to his intension (āśaya) by the purity of morality (śīlapariśuddhi);his
thoughts are like an earth (pṛthivīsama) since there is no high or low (natonnata)
in his mind;he is free from thoughts by pure morality (śīlapariśuddhi);his thought is liberated
(cittamukta) and the gate is free from hinderance (mukhānāvṛta) by accomplishing all
sacrifices (sarvayajñapratipatti);he has perfected memory and eloquence (dhāraṇīpratibhānasaṃpanna)
by investigating the dharma (dharmapravicaya);he depends on the knowledge of supernatural
powers (abhijñājñānāśrita) by going to immeasurable Buddha-fields (aprameyabuddhakṣetragamana);[he
thinks:] ‘Just as the four main elements (cāturmahābhautika) in the external
world nourish all living beings (satvaupajīvya), may the four main elements belonging
to me nourish all living beings!May there be in me no root of good connecting with the
efficiency in knowledge of the dharma that does not support all living beings (mā bhūt tan
mama kuśalamūlaṃ dharmajñānakauśalyam vā yan na sarvvasatvopajīvyaṃ syād)! Thus the roots
of good will be transformed by me.’Quotation from ŚikṣMS 22b3; B 33,11-12; ŚikṣTib(D) 24b1;
ŚikṣChi(T.1636) 82b5-7.ŚikṣMS: āryagaganagañjasūtre ’py āha mā bhūt tan mama kuśalamūlaṃ
dharmajñānakauśalyam vā yan na sarvvasatvopajīvyaṃ syād iti |ŚikṣTib: ’phags pa nam mkha’
mdzod kyi mdo las kyaṅ | bdag gi dge ba’i rtsa ba’am chos la mkhas pa gaṅ yin pa de sems

that way, the bodhisatva, having accumulated immeasurable
merits, nourishes all living beings.

33. BuddhakāryaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva appear to many beings (satveṣu
pratyupasthitaḥ) performing the deeds of a Buddha (buddhakārya) even when the Buddhas
do not appear?Son of good family, the bodhisatva has perfected the purification of the ten
powers (daśabalapariśodhananiryāta) by knowing what is proper and what is improper (sthānāsthānajñāna);he
has perfected the purification of the four fearlessness (caturvaiśāradyapariśodhananiryāta)
by knowing the cessation of impurities (āsravakṣayajñāna);he has perfected
the purification of the eighteen special qualities of the Tathāgata (aṣṭādaśāveṇikabuddhadharmapariśodhananiryāta)
by knowing the unattached knowledge of the three times (tryadhvāsaṅgajñānajñāna);.he
has perfected the purification of five kinds of sight (pañcacakṣuḥpariśodhananiryāta)
by obtaining the light of the sight of the Buddha (buddhacakṣurālokalabdha);he
has perfected the purification of all supernormal knowledges (sarvābhijñāpariśodhananiryāta)
by the attainment of going to the seat of awakening (bodhimaṇḍagamanalabdha);he
has perfected fulfilling all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharmaparipūraṇaniryāta) by completely
cutting off the habitual patterns of vices (kleśavāsanā);he has perfected the purification
of the ornaments of body, speech, thought, the auspicious marks and signs (kāyavākcittalakṣaṇānuvyañjanālaṃkārapariśodhananiryāta)
by accumulating all collections of merits
(sarvapuṇyasaṃbhāropacaya);he has perfected the purification of the ten stages (daśabhūmipariśodhananiryāta)
by obtaining the stage of consecration (abhiṣeka);he has perfected the
purification of all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmapariśodhananiryāta) by accumulating
the collection of knowledges (jñānasaṃbhāropacaya);In that way, son of good family,
the bodhisatva appears to many beings, performing the deeds of the Buddha even when the
Buddhas do not appear.

34. SāgaramudrāsamādhiHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva become unattached to
all thoughts and deeds of living beings (sarvasatvacittacaritāsakta) when he obtains the
ocean seal samādhi (sāgaramudrāsamādhipratilabdha)?.Son of good family, as many as features
of living beings appear in the Jambudvipa World, the seal which is like all of them reflects
in the great ocean, thus it is called the great ocean (māhasāgara).In the same way, as
many as there are the appearance of thoughts (cittāvabhāsa), the appearance of forms (rūpāvabhāsa),
or the appearance of sounds (śabdāvabhāsa), all those reflect in a single appearance
(avabhāsa) of the bodhisatva who maintains the ocean seal samādhi, thus it is called
the ocean seal samādhi (sāgaramudrāsamādhi).Just as the great ocean is of a single taste
(ekarasa), so the dharma of the bodhisatva is also of a single taste since he knows the taste
of liberation (vimukirasa).Just as [the tide of] the great ocean is punctual, so the
bodhisatva is never late for the seat of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa) by investigating when is the
right time and wrong time.Just as the great ocean decomposes a rotting corpse (mahāsāgaro
mṛtakuṇapena sārdhaṃ saṃvasanti), so the bodhisatva breaks down any habitual pattern of
vices (sarvakleśavāsanā) or any thought of disciples and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhacitta).Just
as, no matter how much water in the great ocean is consumed, there
is no increase or decrease, just so, no matter how much the dharma is consumed, the sphere
of the dharma (dharmadhātu) of the bodhisatva is not increased or decreased.Just as the
width of the great ocean is immeasurable, so the insight (prajñā) of the bodhisatva is immeasurable.Just
as the depth of the great ocean is hard to fathom (duravagāha), so the profoundness
of the bodhisatva is hard for disciples and isolated buddhas to understand.Just as
the great ocean is the place of immeasurable living beings, so the maturing of immeasurable
living beings (satvaparipācana) depends on the bodhisatva.This is the entrance of the
ocean seal samādhi (sāgaramudrāsamādhipraveśa), and, son of good family, the bodhisatva who
enters into the way is not attached to the thoughts or deeds of any living being (sarvasatvacittacaritāsakta).

35. SaṅgasamatikramaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva transcend all attachments
(sarvasaṅgasamatikrama)?What is called ‘attachment’ means the manifestation of viewpoints
(dṛṣṭiparyutthāna) on the dharmas.The bodhisatva transcends all attachments since he is
free from any manifestation of viewpoints (dṛṣṭiparyutthāna).Just as the wind (vāyu) is
not attached to the vault of the sky, so the bodhisatva who is endowed with the wind-like
thought is not attached to any living being.

36. ĀlokalabdhaThen, those good men know the way of good conduct (cāritra) and dignified manner
(ācāra). Here, the dignified manner means mindfulness (smṛti) and the good conduct means
non-distraction (avikṣepa).They obtain the light (āloka) being free from darkness (andhakāra).
Here, what is called the darkness is the ignorance (ajñāna) of dharmas, and what is
called the light is the unhindered knowledge (apratihatajñāna) of dharmas, thus those are
called being free from darkness and obtaining the light.

37. SarvajñajñānaThose good men obtain the self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna), not being
dependent on the knowledge of others (jñānāparapraṇeya)..Why is that? This is because
they are dependent on the self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna), and do not seek the
knowledge of other beings (parasatvajñāna).When the bodhisatva does not depend on others,
obtains the self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna), and teaches the knowledge of determining
the dharma (dharmaviniścayajñānanirdeśa), then he immediately attains the knowledge
of omniscience (sarvajñajñāna).

Verses 87-118Then on that occasion the Lord uttered these verses (atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ
velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata):87 The wise one whose thought is detached from any viewpoint
(dṛṣti), who accumulates merits (puṇya), who is without the appearance of distinguishing
marks (nimittāvyutthāna), and who transforms everything into awakening, becomes imperishable.

88 Having abandoned pride and conceit (mānātimāna), seeking for the accumulation of knowledge
(jñānasaṃbhāra), the wise one, having the nature of infinite space (anantagaganasvabhāva),
fulfils the knowledge of omniscience (sarvajñajñānaṃ paripūrayati).

89 Son of the Victorious One (jinaputra), the recollection of the Buddha (buddhānusmṛti) is
without the nature of form or essential character (rūpalakṣaṇadharmatā). Where there is no
moving of thought or mind (cittamanas), there is the recollection of the Buddha.

90 The dharma which is free from desire (rāga), essentially transcendent, always peaceful and
calm, the absence of distinguishing marks (animitta), and is free from any objective support
(sarvālambana) is the recollection of the dharma (dharmānusmṛti).

91 The holy Saṃgha which is unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), empty (śūnyatā), without distinguishing
marks (animitta), liberated from wishing (praṇidhāna) and in which there is no thinking
nor any activity of recollection is the recollection of the Saṇgha (saṃghānusmṛti).

92 The renunciation which abandons all parts of personality (sarvaskandha), gives away any object
of vices (sarvakleśavastu), purified from thought-constructions and discriminations
(kalpavikalpa) without arrogance is the recollection of renunciation (tyāgānusmṛti).

93 The morality which is unsullied (anāsrava), unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), without any activity
of body, speech or mind (kāyavākcitta), without any origination, and not dependent on the
triple states of existence (tribhava) is the recollection of morality (śīlānusmṛti).

94 God is pure and free from impurity (mala) or vices (kleśa), dwells in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha),
and obtains the stage of consecration (abhiṣeka). Recollecting such pure
beings, one thinks “I will also become like him, the Lord, soon.”

95 Grasping the true dharma (saddharma) of the Tathāgata is not to grasp any object of vices
(sarvekleśavastu) and to be liberated from both truth or untruth (dharmādharma), that is
the grasping the true dharma of the Victorious One (Jina).

96 The Victorious One (jina) attains the essential character of awakening (bodhilakṣaṇa), and
grasps the essential character of the dharma (dharmalakṣaṇa). That by which he knows the
limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi) without impurities is the obtaining all qualities of the Buddha
(buddhadharma).

97 If you are pure yourself, living beings (satva) are also pure. The one who penetrates the
wisdom that all dharmas are pure, his mind is basically pure (prakṛtiprabhāsvara), and he
brings living beings to maturity in order for them to get rid of [the misunderstanding of
an eternal] life principle (satva).

98 Not destroying (avināśayati) the sphere of living beings (satvadhātu), not seeing decreasing
or increasing, teaching the abandonment of erroneous viewpoint, thus he purifies many
beings (bahusatva).

99 He who teaches the sphere of this world, also teaches the sphere of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya);
the sphere of the Buddha is just like open space (gagana), in this way he understands
the sphere of this world.

100 When you see all sounds and syllables as an echo (pratiśrutkā), hearing disappears. This
kind of insight (prajñā) is to obtain the memory (dhāraṇī).

101 While remembering, reciting, and explaining various teachings of the dharma, if you do not
have any conception of self, living beings or even the dharma, then that is being established
in memory (dhāraṇī).

102 Keeping the words of the Victorious One (jina), satisfying all living beings by eloquent
speech (subhāṣita), never being separated from concentration (samādhi) with pure recollection,
that is the qualities of the certainty of the memory (dhāraṇīniyāmaguṇa).

103 Not accumulating the dharma, not moving or wavering in the dharma, just as the nāgas bring
down the incessant rain, so you should pour down the rain of the dharma (dharmavarṣa).

104 Eloquence (pratibhāna) which is the sources of good qualities (guṇākara) is without hindrance
or interruption and is explaining thousand koṭis of sūtras (sūtrasahasrakoṭi) without
discrimination of living beings by their abilities (satvendriya).

105 By the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva), for the thousands koṭis of aeons, the dharma
has been taught uninterruptedly. Living beings have been satisfied according to their wishes
because the qualities of the Buddha have been established by the principle of eloquence
(pratibhāna).

106 “All these dharmas are just as empty space,” knowing the aspects of all dharmas like this,
he does not hold any concept of living beings, life principle, or person, this is to transcend
the Māra inherent in the parts of personality (skandhamāra).

107 Since all living beings are originally extinguished (prakṛtinirvṛta), they are never born.
His patience shining like this is not carelessness (apramāda) about this teaching.

108 Seeing all parts of personality (skandha) as an illusion (māyā), knowing all spheres as
the sphere of the dharma (dharmadhātu), considering the six sense organs (ṣaḍindriya) as an
empty town (śūnyagrāma), this is to transcend the Māra inherent in the parts of personality
(skandhamāra).

109 Being aware of that vices (kleśa) are just like a mass of clouds (abhrakūṭa), examining
the dharma correctly, and not making any thought-construction or fiction (akalpāvikalpa),
this is to transcend the Māra inherent in vices (kleśamāra).

110 He who knows that there is no arising of birth, death, or transmigration, and there is no
coming or going of the dharmas, he is not subject to the Māra of death (mṛtyumāra).

111 He who has no agitated or conceited thinking, who nurtures no idea of awakening (bodhisaṃjñā)
even while abiding in awakening, and who practices compassion (karuṇā) even though he
nurtures no idea of a self or living beings, he conquers the Māra and his forces (sabala).

112 Seeing both consciousness and knowledge (vijñānajñāna) equally, not being established in
the conditioned nor the unconditioned, and regarding the thoughts of migrating beings (jagaccitta)
as an illusion (māyā), that is the heroic uncrushability (anavamṛdya).

113 Not being attached to this side nor that side, sailing the vessel of the dharma (dharmanau),
and liberating living beings without any idea of them, that is called the sameness of
the bodhisatva.

114 He who knows that the three realms are just like a wilderness (kāntāra) which is void and
unchangeable, but who still liberates living beings according to regular order (anupūrva),
he is a caravan leader (sārthavāha) who guides the way to ambrosia (amṛta).

115 The learned who is skilled in the proper way and the improper way, who knows that the dharmas
are empty from the very beginning, but who still leads [living beings] to liberation
(nirvāṇa) by logical way, he is the bodhisatva called ‘a leader (nāyaka).’

116 He who knows that the train of thoughts (cittasaṃtāna) always changes into somethings else,
the [present] thought is not connected to the [past or future] thoughts, and thus the
train of thoughts is migrating, he is the bodhisatva called ‘a principle (pariṇāyaka).’

117 Just as the nature of open space (gaganasvabhāva) or the moon reflected in water (udakacandra),
all dharmas are pure and impeccable. Not being contaminated by any vice (kleśa), pure
beings (pariśuddhasatva) are irreproachable (anindita).

118 He who, by a single dharma, knows that all dharmas are ungraspable, void, unreal, and impermanent
just like an illusion or a mirage, he will soon reach the place of awakening.(ekena
dharmeṇa tu sarvadharmān anugacchate māyamarīcisādṛśān ||agrāhyatucchān alikān aśāśvatān

VyākaraṇaWhen this decisive teaching was declared, seventy-two millions of gods, humans, asuras,
kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and other beings produced the thought of incomparable complete awakening
(iha dharmaniścaye nirdiśyamāne dvisaptatidevamānuṣāsurakinnaramahoragaprāṇiniyutānām
anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni);thirty-two thousand bodhisatvas attained
the tolerance that all things are unborn (dvātriṃśatīnāṃ ca bodhisatvasahasrāṇām anutpattikadharmakṣāntiḥ
pratilabdhā);this world system of three thousandfold worlds was shaken
in its six ways (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātuś ca ṣaḍvikāraḥ prakampito abhūt);and the
world was illuminated by a grand lustre (avabhāsa).A hundred thousand gods, having let fall
the rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa) and played the celestial cymbals (tūrya), uttered a joyous
utterance (udānam udānayati): “Living beings who, having heard this teaching, believe
it, embrace it, practice it, and proceed to the realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya).All the
Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra), where the Awakened Lords appear, are adorned with ornaments
and respected by the wise.Why is that? When the Buddhas appear, such dharma will be taught,
and the good men (satpurṣa) endowed with inconceivable qualities (acintyadharma) will see
it.”Then the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja, having heard the Buddha’s prediction
(vyākaraṇa), being delighted, offered to the body of the Buddha with a net of pearls (muktājāla)
having an immaculate and pure radiance (vimalaviśuddhaprabha) with the value of
pearls filling the three thousandfold world-system, and then he addressed himself to the
Lord:“The knowledge of the Awakened Lords is free from any attachment or obstruction; his
teaching is without interruption; and the Tathāgata sees the thoughts of all living beings
and is skilled in knowing the superior or inferior abilities of them (indriyavarāvarajñāna).Since
the Lord teaches such guiding principle of the dharma (dharmanaya), all congregations
are satisfied,the great vehicle (mahāyāna) is praised,and the bodhisatvas, having been
assembled from the worlds of ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu), were praised with this great
light of the dharma.Since the Lord Tathāgata teaches the entrance into the dharma (dharmamukha)
to us, based on the entrance into the source of the dharma, we will teach the immeasurable
entrance into the dharma.

V. Miracle

PuṣpavarṣaGaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 4Then the bodhisatva, the great being named Āśupratibhāna
joined this assembly, was seated with them, and said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
(atha khalu āśupratibhāno nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tatraiva pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt
sanniṣaṇṇo gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ etad avocat):.“Son of good family, if your name is Gaganagañja,
is this open space (gagana) your treasury (gañja)?”Gaganagañja said: “So it is,
son of good family, the open space is my treasury (gagano mama gañjaḥ).”Āśupratibhāna said:
“Son of good family, let us see the distinction of open space and treasury (gaganagañjaviśeṣa).Then
the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu
bhagavān gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvam mahāsatvam idam avocat):“Son of good family, let us see
the distinction of open space and treasury.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to
the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna:“Whatever you want, son of good family, I will pour it down
from open space as a rain.”Then the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna made a wish:“I have seen a lotus
flower called ‘Sarvaprabhāvavairocana’ in the Padmavyūha universe of the Tathāgata Śrīratnotpala,
that would be one krośa wide,consisting of hundred koṭis of young and tender petals,is
pleasant to touch like soft cloth (kācilindika),has a fragrance (gandha) which filled
the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra),and has many hundred thousand colors (varṇa).Thus when
the bodhisatvas see the lotus flower, they are in rapture and unable to take their eyes
off it.By seeing the lotus flower and by smelling its fragrance, the bodhisatvas attain concentration
(samādhi).Please pour down the rain of such lotus flowers on us.”Immediately
after the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna made a wish thus, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja (gaganagañjādhiṣṭhāna), the rain of such lotus flowers began to pour down
from the vault of the sky (gaganatala).Then, by smelling the lotus flowers, the whole assembly
entered into the concentration called Prītyāhāra.Having emerged from the concentration,
the whole assembly bowed to the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna, and said:“The magical presence
of the good man (satpurṣādhiṣṭhāna) and the power of insight (prajñābala) are good, these
are good.May all living beings attain magical presence such as this (sarvasatvā īdṛśasya
adhiṣṭhānasya lābhino bhavantu)!”

RatnavarṣaThen the bodhisatva Ratnavyūha joined this assembly (atha khalu ratnavyūho nāma bodhisatvo
sannipatito ’bhūt), was seated with them, and said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Please,
son of good family, pour down a rain of gold dust.”Immediately after the bodhisatva
Ratnavyūha said thus, the rain of gold dust poured down from the sky.Then the bodhisatva
Ratnavyūha said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son of good family, please pour down
rain of all kinds of jewels from the sky.”Immediately after his words, the great rain of
immeasurable, incalculable amount of jewels, equal to Mount Sumeru in size, with various kinds
of names and colors, poured down from ten directions.To wit, gold (suvarṇa), silver (rajata),
crystal (sphaṭika), lapis lazuli (vaiḍūrya), emerald (aśmagarbha), ruby (lohitamuktikā),
white coral (musāragalva), Śrīgarbha gem, stainless jewel, red coral gem, moonstone
(candraprabhā), sunstone (sūryakānta), illuminating gem, brightening gem, Jambū-light gem,
fire-light gem, conch shell (śaṅkha), crystal (śilā), red coral (pravāla), sapphire (indranīla),
Guṇākara gem, calm light gem, water-light gem, water-like gem, transparent gem,
earthy light gem, indestructible gem, blinding gem, śakra-holding gem, victor’s gem, the great
victor’s gem, blazing light gem, the victor’s essence of glory gem, adamantine gem, worldly
light gem, Jyotīrasa gem, shining gem, Ardhacandra gem, Jambū-water-light gem, Jambūdvīpa-light
gem, thousand lights gem, shooting star gem, burning light gem, … and nameless
gems; the rain of these jewels poured down, and it was not easy to enumerate all the names
of precious jewels even for an aeon.

ĀhāracīvaravarṣaThen the bodhisatva named Kālarāja addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“In
this Saha universe (sahālokadhātu), son of good family, there are living beings
suffering from poverty (daridra), lacking food or drink (anannapāna), and wearing ragged
clothes; there are hungry ghosts (preta) tormented by hunger and thirst (kṣutpipāsā), covering
themselves with their hairs, and subsisting on such as spittle, mucus, blood, and pus
(kheṭasiṃhāṇarudhirapūya). In order to protect these living beings, please pour down the
rain of food, drink, and clothing!”Immediately after that, by the magical presence of the
bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the rain of all kinds of delicious hard foods, soft foods (khādanīyabhojanīya),
and soups poured down;the rain of all kinds of tasty beverages poured down to
the depth of a chariot’s axle (akṣamātrābhir dhārābhiḥ);the rain of many hundred thousand
colors of clothes, which are pleasant to touch like the thin and soft cloth (kācilindika),
poured down.Then, in this world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu),
all the wretched and poor (sarvakṛpaṇadaridra), and all hungry ghosts (sarvapreta)
were satisfied.

AmṛtavarṣaThen the bodhisatva Vaidyarāja addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son
of good family, there are patients (vyādhita) suffering from many diseases without nurse.
For the sake of them, please pour down the rain of great medicine by which all the sick
get free from sickness!”Immediately after that, the rain of ambrosia (amṛtavarṣa) poured down
from the open space (āntarīkṣa), and all the sick were free from all diseases.

PāramitāvarṣaThen the bodhisatva Apāyajaha addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son
of good family, please pacify three evil existences (tryapāya).”Immediately after that,
a bright light shone from the open space (āntarīkṣa), and the inhabitants of hell (naraka),
animals (tairyagyonika), and the inhabitants of Yāma’s world (yamalaukika), all those
who were touched by the light were filled with happiness (sukha), and so all beings in the
three evil existences were pacified.Then, the rain of gifts, such as flowers (puṣpa), garlands
(mālā), incenses (gandha), unguents (upalepana), aromatic powers (cūrṇa), religious
robes (cīvara), parasols (chattra), banners (dhvaja), pennons (patākā), five kinds of musical
instruments (vādita), songs, male servants (dāsa), female servants (dāsī), wives (bhāryā),
boys (dāraka), girls (kanyā), female attendants (dāra), horses (aśva), elephants (hasti),
chariots (ratha), foot-soldiers (patti), vehicles (vāha), houses (gṛha), villages (sagrāma),
cities (nagara), towns (nigama), provinces (janapada), kingdoms (rāṣṭra), capitals
(rājadhāni), gardens (udyāna), pavilions (kūṭāgāra), palaces (prāsāda), portals (toraṇa),
windows (gavākṣa), half-moon shaped decorations on building (ardhacandra), thrones (mañca),
palanquin (śivika), and chariots drawn by four cattle, sixteen cattle, and a thousand of
good horses (aśvājāneya), poured down from the open space.Thus the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
sustained by the magical presence said to the whole congregation of bodhisatvas:“Sons of
good family, having received all these riches, give them all away, and fulfill the perfection
of generosity (dānapāramitā)!”Then the bodhisatva named Śīlālaṃkāra said this to the
bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son of good family, if the rain of the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā)
poured down by your magical power, why do you not pour down the rain of the perfection
of morality (śīlapāramitā)?”Immediately after his words, the buddhas and bodhisatvas
in ten directions praised the adornments of the virtues of morality (śīlaguṇālaṃkāra),
and the voice of praising the virtues of morality, as many expressions as there are, resonated
in the open space (āntarīkṣa).In the same way, the voices of [praising] the virtues
of tolerance, vigour, meditation, and insight (kṣāntivīryadhyānaprajñā) [resonated in the
open space.] As long as the buddhas and bodhisatvas in ten directions taught a hundred thousand
ways into the dharma (dharmamukha) by means of syllables, explanations, and agreed
terms (akṣaraniruktisaṃketa), all those voices of the dharma, which never increase or decrease
and do not enter into any difference, resonated in the open space endlessly.By the sound
of the dharma, all living beings in this world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu)
obtained this understanding,and thus immeasurable and incalculable
living beings became matured in the three vehicles (triyāna).

Dharmavarṣa no dharnavarṣa sectionThen the bodhisatva named Samantāloka thought like this:Does
this magical arrangement (vyūha) of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja exist only in this world,
or in other world-spheres as well?The bodhisatva Gaganagañja, knowing telepathically the
thought of the bodhisatva Samatāloka, said to him (atha gaganagañjo bodhisatvo bodhisatvasya
samatālokasya cetasā cetaḥparivitarkam ājñāya bodhisatvaṃ samatālokam etad avocat):“Son
of good family, if you gain the divine sight (divyacakṣur) which is completely clear and
pure, son of good family, you can look at whatever can be seen in the world-spheres of ten
directions (daśadiglokadhātu).”Then when the bodhisatva Samantāloka examined the world-spheres
of ten directions by the divine sight, in immeasurable and incalculable Buddha-fields
of the ten directions, just as the rain of all kinds of jewels poured down and all voices
of the dharma resounded in this Sahā universe, just so in those Buddha-fields he saw that
such phenomena occurred without increasing or decreasing, and without entering into any
difference.Then the bodhisatva Samantāloka, having been astonished (āścaryaprāpta), uttered
a joyous utterance (udānam udānayati): “The accomplishment of the magical presence (adhiṣṭhāna)
of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s vow (praṇidhāna) is inconceivable (acintya).O Good
man (satpuruṣa), please pure down a rain like this on all the buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra)
immediately.”Then, by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva) and the magical presence
of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the whole assembly saw the rain of jewels (ratnavarṣa) and
the rain of the dharma (dharmavarṣa) pouring down on those buddha-fields.By this miracle (prātihārya),
the rain of jewels (ratnavarṣa) and the rain of the dharma (dharmavarṣa), performed
by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, immeasurable beings (gaṇanāsamatikrāntasatva) produced
the thought of awakening (samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni).

NirmitapuruṣaThen five hundred widows, having departed from the city of Rājagṛha and proceeded
to the place where the bodhisatva Gaganagañja stayed, said this to him:“If you fulfill
the wishes of all living beings, O Good man (satpuruṣa), please return our husbands.”Immediately
after that, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, five hundred men
resembling their deceased husbands in colors, distinguishing marks, and appearances (varṇanimittasaṃsthāna),
having descended from the open space (gaganād avatīrya), settled down
in front of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja.Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to the women:“Sisters
(bhaginī), bring your respective husbands just as they were (yathābhūta).”Then
the women, having brought their respective husbands, being filled with rejoicing and happiness
of mind, returned to their respective homes.After that, by those magically created
beings (nirmitāḥ puruṣāḥ), during seven days (saptāha), the women were brought to maturity,
in the way that they attained the stage of not falling back (avaivartika) from the supreme
and perfect awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).Then the five hundred widows, having come
to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, uttered these verses:
