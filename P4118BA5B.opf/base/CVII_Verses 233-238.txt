233 Even though the bodhisatva sees immeasurably extensive fields in ten directions by the eye
of the buddha (buddhalocanā), fills all those places with jewels, and gives them as a gift,
if there is someone who retains, reads and teaches such excellent and unsullied sūtra
which has been taught by many buddhas, then his merit would be better.234 Even though the
bodhisatva fills all those fields with flowers (puṣpa), fragrances (sugandha), ointments
(vilepana), parasols (chattra), flags (patākā), banners (dhvaja) and wreath s of cloth, and
makes an offering to the buddhas, if there is someone taking care of the true dharma (saddharma)
to be grasped at the time of the disintegration and cessation of the dharma of the
Well-gone One (sugata), then his merit would be better.235 Even though the bodhisatva places
a lamp (pradīpa) on shrines (caitya) dedicated to the Victorious One (jina), which is
filled with perfumed oil like the ocean (sāgara) in ten directions and made of a wick (varti)
like the Mt. Sumeru, if there is someone who, having known that the whole world is covered
by darkness (andhakāra), upholds this dharma taught by the Victorious One when the lamp
of the dharma (dharmapradīpa) is extinguished, then his merit would be better.236 Even
though the bodhisatva, seeking the highest awakening (agrabodhi) of the buddha, seeing the
leaders (nāyaka) in ten millions of fields, has offered beautiful [clothes] made of silk
for many millions of aeons, if there is someone who, giving thanks to the buddha, upholding
(anugraha) the three jewels (triratna), grasps the true dharma (saddharma) to be apprehended
by living beings, then his merit would be better.237 In the same way that I grasp the
dharma of the protectors (nātha), I see living beings by the eye of the buddha (buddhalocanā)
and teach them to be Śakras or Brahmās, but it does not increase merit that much. Even
though I teach all those beings to be the worthy ones (arhat) or to mount on the vehicle
of the isolated buddha (pratyekayāna), if there is someone who, having generated the thought
of awakening (bodhicitta), upholds the true dharma (saddharma), then it would be better
(viśiṣṭa).238 If his merit has a material form, all the fields in ten direction would be
filled up with it, and there would be no vessel [to contain that merit] except for the the
knowledge of the best of men (puruṣarṣabhajñāna). Just as, even if one expresses the knowledge
of the buddha (buddhajñāna) for ten thousand aeons, there will be no end, just so
it is impossible to measure the merit of upholding the true dharma of the tathāgata.

Then the bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra, having heard this teaching on the merit of upholding the true
dharma from the Lord, became contented, elated, enraptured, overjoyed, exultant and jubilant
(tuṣṭodagrāttamanāḥ pramuditaḥ prītisaumanasyajāto bhavati), and addressed himself
to the Lord:“O Lord, the bodhisatvas, who do not strive for upholding the true dharma, will
be beset by the Māra (mārādhiṣṭhita).If, O Lord, there are bodhisatvas who [have planted]
all other roots of good without upholding the true dharma, their merits would be merely
as a mustard seed (sarṣapa).The roots of good stemming from upholding the true dharma are
established in the conception of a self (ātmasaṃjñā), which is exactly the same as the sphere
of space (gaganadhātu) in ten directions.In order to seek for the happiness of all living
beings (sarvasatvasukha), O Lord, I will give up my body and soul (kāyajīvita), and, without
desiring any happiness for me, will put on the armour for the sake of upholding the
true dharma.”When this exposition of religion was set forth, due to the maturation of the
bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s merit, in order to pay homage (pūjākarmaṇa) to this exposition of
religion (dharmaparyāya), the bodhisatvas, who have the same thoughts with the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja, dwelling in immeasurable buddha-fields in ten directions, poured down the rain
of flowers (puṣpavarṣa) from the vault of the sky.Then this sound resonated in open space:
“While adorning and upholding this chapter of the Great Collection (mahāsaṃnipātaparivarta),
the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja has done the buddha-activities (buddhakārya).The
living beings who are not separated from the thought of awakening (bodhicittāviyukta)
will uphold this exposition of religion, and in the same way, they will adorn the true
dharma.”Then at that time, the Lord emitted such light from his body, thereby all buddha-fileds
in ten directions became filled with it.When the beginning, middle and end of this
exposition of religion was set forth, immeasurable, incalculable living beings produced
the thought of awakening, and attained the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti).]Some
of their thoughts were liberated, some of them attained the eyes of
the dharma (dharmacakṣuḥ), some of them became free from desire, some of them acquired the
good qualities of gods and men (devamanuṣyasaṃpatti) and gathered causes for seeing other
buddhas, and even the Lord was pleased with all of them.As the Lord had uttered these words,
the bodhisatva great being Gaganagañja, the bodhisatva great being Maitreya, the bodhisatva
great being Kutūhalajāta, the bodhisatva great being Ratnapāṇi, the bodhisatva great
being Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva great being Guṇarājaprabhāsa, the bodhisatva great being
Puṇyālaṃkāra, the bodhisatva great being Apāyajaha, the bodhisatva great being Dharmarāja,
the venerable Śāriputra, the venerable Mahākāśyapa, the venerable Ānanda, the Brahmā king
of Sahā, Śakra king of the gods, the Four Great Kings, the monks, the bodhisatvas, the whole
of that assembly, and the world with its gods, human beings, anti-gods and gandharvas
praised what the Lord had preached (idam avocad bhagavān āttamanā gaganagañjo bodhisatvo
mahāsatvaḥ ca maitreyo bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca kutūhalajāto bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca ratnapāṇir
