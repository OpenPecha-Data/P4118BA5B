15. BodhisatvacaryāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva perform his practice of
a bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā) after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā)?The
extinction (nirvāṇa) is the pacification of all vices (sarvakleśapraśamana),the
allaying of every feeling (sarvavedanāpratipraśrambhaṇa),the pacification of all objects
(sarvālambanapraśamana),and no connection (pratisaṃdhi) with the parts of personality, spheres
or fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana).Thus the good man (satpuruṣa), having obtained
the sameness of extiction (nirvāṇasamatā), playfully employs (vikrīḍita) the great
compassion (mahākaruṇā), means and insight (prajñopāya), and knowledge (jñāna) of the former
lives (pūrvanivāsa);he is sustained by the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhitai);he
cultivates insight (prajñā) and knowledge (jñāna);he purifies cultivation (bhavānā)
by means of the clear presence of manifestation (bhāvānapariśuddhi);he depends on concentration
(samādhi) which is the miraculous play (vikrīḍita) with illusion (māyā);The vices
by which he might produce existence and bonds of existence, these he does away with (yaiḥ
kleśaḥ saṃsāraṃ saṃsārabandhanaṃ vā prabhāvayati tān prajahāti), and the knowledge by
means of which he teaches extinction, in that he excels (yena jñānena nirvāṇaṃ deśayati tatra
vaśitāprāptaḥ), thus he is born from non-existence and originated form non-origination
(anutpādotpanno ’bhūtabhūtaḥ).Even though he is established in the sameness of extinction
(nirvāṇasamatāsaṃprasthita), he still does not interrupt bringing living beings to maturity
(satvaparipāka).This, son of good family, is the gate of knowledge (jñānamukha), called
the development of two approaches (yamakapariṇāma), [namely the great compassion (mahākāruṇā)
and expedient means (upāya)] of the bodhisatvas, and even though the bodhisatva is placed
in the gate of knowledge after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā),
he still performs the practice of a bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā).
