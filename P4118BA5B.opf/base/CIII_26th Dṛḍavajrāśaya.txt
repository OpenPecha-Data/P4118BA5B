26. DṛḍavajrāśayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva with a resolve firm and unbrekable
(dṛḍhābhedyāśaya) like the diamond (yathāvajra) become well established (susthita)
and unwavering (aniñjya) in this great way?Son of good family, when the bodhisatva is unbreakable
(abhedya) having made a resolve as firm as a diamond with the twelve qualities,
he is not disturbed by the world with its gods (sadevakena lokena). What are those twelve
(katamāni dvādaśa)?To wit, a) since the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), intention (āśaya),
and determination (adhyāśaya) are unbreakable (abhedya), the practice (prayoga) is also
unbreakable;b) the generosity (dāna) is unbreakable, and the morality, tolerance, vigour,
meditation, and insight (dānaśīlakṣāntivīryadhyānaprajñā) are unbreakable;c) great friendliness
(mahāmaitrī) and great compassion (mahākaruṇa) are unbreakable;d) the way of attraction
(saṃgrahavastu) is unbreakable;e) bringing living beings to maturity (satvaparipācana)
is unbreakable;f) the purification of the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetrapariśuddhi) is unbreakable;g)
indefatigability in existence (saṃsārāparikheda) is unbreakable;f) non-satisfaction
for the root of good (kuśalamūlātṛpti) is unbreakable;g) endless offerings (atyantayajña)
for the sake of obtaining the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty
(lakṣaṇānuvyañjana) are unbreakable;h) giving up body and life in order to uphold the true
religion (saddharmaparigrahāya kāyajīvitaparityāgaḥ) is unbreakable;i) dedicating his roots
of good (kuśalamūlapariṇāmana) for the sake of other beings (parasatvapudgala) is unbreakable;j)
his accumulation of all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmasamudānaya)
is unbreakable.When the qualities of bodhisatva are unbreakable in that way, son of good family,
he is unbreakable having made a resolve as firm as a diamond (dṛḍhavajrāśaya).Just
as a diamond (maṇiratnavajra) breaks any kind of gem without being broken itself, so the bodhisatva,
having made a resolve as firm as a diamond, removes bad habits, manifestations
of vices, and wrong views (anuśayakleśaparyutthānadṛṣṭigata) of all living beings, but still
he himself is not broken because of this great vehicle (mahāyāna).In this way, son of good
family, the bodhisatva is unbreakable having made a resolves as firm as a diamond, being
well established and unshakable in this great way.
