27. BuddhaviṣayaHow then, son of good family, does the own realm (svaviṣaya) of the bodhisatva
become pure, when he has attained the realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)?‘The realm of
the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)’ is not a realm, and since it is non-realm, it is purified of any
realm.Thus the bodhisatva purifies his own sphere (svaviṣaya) by the purity of the sphere
of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayapariśuddhi), and he thinks: “the realm of sight (cakṣurviṣaya)
is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.”Why
is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm (vivekaviṣaya),
and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of sight.The realm of hearing (śrotraviṣaya)
is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness
or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm,
and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of hearing.The realm of smelling (ghrāṇaviṣaya)
is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or
farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and
the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of smelling.The realm of tasting (jihvāviṣaya)
is the realm of the Buddha, in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why
is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent
realm is beyond the realm of tasting.The realm of touching (kāyaviṣaya) is the realm
of the Buddha, in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that?
This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent
realm is beyond the realm of touching.The realm of mind (manoviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha,
and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is
because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is
beyond the realm of mind.It is the same case with the parts of personality, spheres, fields
of sense perception, (skandhadhātvāyatana) and the twelve links of dependent origination
(dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva enters into
every realm as transcendent, and belonging to the realm of the Buddha.Entering into the
field of the Buddha (buddhakṣetrapraveśa) by the purity of his own field (svakṣetrapariśuddhi)
is the following: All the moments of existence appearing in his six sense organs (ṣaḍindriya),
all those he enters as being transcendent as realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayaviveka).Just
as the realm of the Tathāgata (tathāgataviṣaya) is unattached and unobstructed,
so there is no attachment or obstruction in all realms.In this way, son of good family, the
bodhisatva, entering into the realm of the Buddha, purifies his own realm.
