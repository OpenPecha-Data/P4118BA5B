AmṛtavarṣaThen the bodhisatva Vaidyarāja addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son
of good family, there are patients (vyādhita) suffering from many diseases without nurse.
For the sake of them, please pour down the rain of great medicine by which all the sick
get free from sickness!”Immediately after that, the rain of ambrosia (amṛtavarṣa) poured down
from the open space (āntarīkṣa), and all the sick were free from all diseases.
