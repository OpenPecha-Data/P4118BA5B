18. DharmasvabhāvaBut further, son of good family, in the perspective of the essential character
of the dharma (dharmasvabhāva), the bodhisatva may grasp an essential character, thinking:
“I have fully understood (abhisambuddha) the dharmas.”But, how then has the Tathāgata
understood (abhisaṃbuddha) the dharmas?[It is like this:] their nature is [like] illusion
(māyāsvabhāva) because it is not established in reality (apariniṣpanna);their nature is
[like] a dream (svapna) because it transcends perceptual fields (viṣayātikrantatarayogena);their
nature is [like] a mirage (marīci) because there is no birth (atyantānutpanna);their
nature is [like] a reflected image (pratibhāsa) because it is unchanging (asaṃkrānti);their
nature is [like] a reflection (pratibimba) because it is devoid of intrinsic nature (niḥsvabhāva);their
nature is empty (sūnya) because it is dependent (aparādhīna);their nature
is without distinguishing mark (animitta) because it is beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpa);their
nature is wishless (apraṇihita) because it is not attached to thoughts (cittāsaṅga);their
nature has no desire (rāga) because it is free from all desires (sarvarāgavigata);their
nature is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta) because there is no any calculation (asaṃkhya).Thus,
son of good family, based on the information (prajñapti) in conventional expressions
(vyavahāra) of others I was fully awakened (abhisaṃbuddha) to such dharmas,but still,
their essential character (dharmasvabhāvalakṣaṇa) is inexpressible in words.Even though
the bodhisattva, who wishes to grasp the dharmas, is fully awakened to dharmas with such
an essential character, he still teaches other beings (parasatvapudgala) by means of syllables
and explanations of language (akṣaranirukti).
