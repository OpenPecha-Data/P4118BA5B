21 The one who is endowed with the thought and mind (cittamanas) of equality toward living beings,
who is established in the sameness of knowledge of well-reflected thought, who is the
way of entering into the non-thought (acitta), him, the Lord, I ask for the sake of them
[namely all living beings].

22 The one who is free from the impurities of darkness after attaining splendour (ālokalabdha),
who cuts off the mind of doubt (vimati) of the doubtful, and therefore establishes [living
beings] in liberation (vimokṣa), him, the Sugata I ask for the sake of them.

23 The one whose mind (manas) is perfectly pure (suviśuddha) because of selflessness in oneself
(ātmanairātmya), who takes pleasure in the absence of any principle of living being (satva),
while still engaging in the cause of all living beings (satvārtha), who makes them
free from the twofold selflessnesses (nairātmyadvaya), he is the well defined (viniścita)
of religious discourses (dharmakathā),

24 The one who is pure (pariśuddha) in his religious vows (vrata) in the sphere (gocara) of
precepts (vidhi), whose thought (citta) is like empty space (gaganasama) bacuse of his purified
intensions (śuddhāśaya), and who is not moving (aniñjya), stabilized like Meru, for
the sake of them I ask the Lord for his imperturbable activity (amoghakārya).

25 The one who never falls back (avivārya) from firm vigour (dṛḍhavīrya), bravely conquers conceit,
the Māra, and enemies (nihatamānamārapratyarthika), and purifies the impurities of
vices (kleśa) of oneself and others, I ask the beautiful one (sudarśana) for the sake of
them.

26 The one who is pleased to practice the perfections of generosity, morality, tolerance, vigour,
meditation, liberation, and insight (dānaśīlakṣāntivīryadhyānavimokṣaprajñāpāramitā),
and who [attains] the supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) through meditation and the light of
liberation, I ask [the Lord] for the sake of happiness and purity (prāmodyāmalārthāya).

27 The one who is established in the emptiness, the absence of distinguishing marks, and the
absence of wishful thinking (śūnyatānimittāpraṇidhāna), reveals death and birth (cyutyupapatti)
in accordance with his intention (saṃcintya), but who is beyond birth, abiding, and
death, I ask [the Lord] about the behaviour of men for the sake of them.

28 The religious discourses (dharmakathā), which are profound (gambhīra) and difficult to understand
(duravagāha), difficult to see (durdṛśa) for disciples, isolated buddhas (śrāvakapratyekabuddha)
and other beings, but which inspires every living being, I ask the Sugata
for them.

29 The one who delights in the well done (sukṛta) and perfected dharma, who is free from the
twofold grasping (dvayagrāha) of truth or untruth (dharmādharma), and who constantly takes
pleasure in the dharma through the excellent concentration (samādhi), him I ask about the
of the space-like subject (ākāśasamārtha) of mind.

30 The one who takes pleasure in the dharma which is to keep the lineage of the buddhas (buddhavaṃsa),
who constantly praises the buddhas, who is highly renowned in the three worlds,
I ask the Lord in order to worship the one whose virtues are like the ocean (guṇasāgara).

IV. 37 Answers

When this had been said, the Lord spoke to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (evam
ukte bhagavān gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ mahāsatvam etad avocat):“Excellent! Excellent, son
of good family! Son of good family, you have done well to ask the Tathāgata.That is to say
(tadyathā), you will attain the light of all teachings of the Buddha because you are a spiritual
friend (kalyāṇamitra) who asked (adhyeṣita) a question not being asked by any living
being.You have been clad in the armour of great friendliness and great compassion (mahāmaitrīmahākaruṇasaṃnāhasaṃnaddha),
have honored the immeasurable Buddhas (gaṇanāsamatikrāntabuddhaparyupāsita),
have been never satisfied to seek religion (atṛptadharmaparyeṣṭi),
have transcended all aspects of conceit (sarvamānākārasamatikrāta) by means of the sword of
knowledge (jñānaśastra), have constantly strived for the benefit of living beings (satatasamitaṃ
satvārthābhiyukta), have transcended the eight conditions of the world (aṣṭalokadharmasamatikrāta),
and have attained the gnosis of omniscience (sarvajñajñānasamāpanna) since
your mind is like the expanse of the sky (gaganasamacitta). Son of good family, it is
difficult to know the end of your qualities (guṇa).Because of that, son of good family, listen
well and intently, keep it in mind. I will tell how the bodhisatvas, the great beings,
attain these qualities and others. (tena hi kulaputra sṛṇu sādhu ca suṣṭhu ca manasikuru,
bhāṣiṣye ’ham te yathā bodhisatvā mahāsatvā imān dharmān anyāñ ca prāpsyante)“Yes, Lord.”
The bodhisatva Gaganagañja answered and began to listen. The Lord said to him: (sādhu bhagavan
iti bodhisatvo gaganagañjo bhagavataḥ pratyaśrauṣīt | bhagavāṃs teṣām etad avocat)
