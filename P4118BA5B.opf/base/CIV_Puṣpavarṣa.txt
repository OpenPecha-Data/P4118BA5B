PuṣpavarṣaGaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 4Then the bodhisatva, the great being named Āśupratibhāna
joined this assembly, was seated with them, and said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja
(atha khalu āśupratibhāno nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tatraiva pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt
sanniṣaṇṇo gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ etad avocat):.“Son of good family, if your name is Gaganagañja,
is this open space (gagana) your treasury (gañja)?”Gaganagañja said: “So it is,
son of good family, the open space is my treasury (gagano mama gañjaḥ).”Āśupratibhāna said:
“Son of good family, let us see the distinction of open space and treasury (gaganagañjaviśeṣa).Then
the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu
bhagavān gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvam mahāsatvam idam avocat):“Son of good family, let us see
the distinction of open space and treasury.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to
the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna:“Whatever you want, son of good family, I will pour it down
from open space as a rain.”Then the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna made a wish:“I have seen a lotus
flower called ‘Sarvaprabhāvavairocana’ in the Padmavyūha universe of the Tathāgata Śrīratnotpala,
that would be one krośa wide,consisting of hundred koṭis of young and tender petals,is
pleasant to touch like soft cloth (kācilindika),has a fragrance (gandha) which filled
the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra),and has many hundred thousand colors (varṇa).Thus when
the bodhisatvas see the lotus flower, they are in rapture and unable to take their eyes
off it.By seeing the lotus flower and by smelling its fragrance, the bodhisatvas attain concentration
(samādhi).Please pour down the rain of such lotus flowers on us.”Immediately
after the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna made a wish thus, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja (gaganagañjādhiṣṭhāna), the rain of such lotus flowers began to pour down
from the vault of the sky (gaganatala).Then, by smelling the lotus flowers, the whole assembly
entered into the concentration called Prītyāhāra.Having emerged from the concentration,
the whole assembly bowed to the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna, and said:“The magical presence
of the good man (satpurṣādhiṣṭhāna) and the power of insight (prajñābala) are good, these
are good.May all living beings attain magical presence such as this (sarvasatvā īdṛśasya
adhiṣṭhānasya lābhino bhavantu)!”
