Son of good family, there are eight patiences reflecting on (nidhyapti) the dharma of the bodhisatvas.
What are the eight?a) the patience of emptiness (śūnyatākṣānti) because there is
no destruction (vināśa) of views;b) the patience of signlessness (animittakṣānti) because
signs are not excluded;c) the patience of wishlessness (apraṇihitakṣānti) because there
is no wish in awakening (bodhi);d) the patience of the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskārakṣānti)
because there is no destruction of conditioned things (saṃskṛtavināśa);e) the patience without
birth (ajātakṣānti) because characters (lakṣaṇa) are unconditioned (asaṃskṛta);f) the
patience without origination (anutpādakṣānti) because there is no arising and abiding (utpādasthiti);g)
the patience without being (niḥsatvakṣānti) because there is no destruction
of things (vastuvināśa);h) patience truly as it is (yathābhūtakṣānti) because there is
no destruction by time (kālavināśa);
