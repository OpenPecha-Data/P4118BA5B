ĀhāracīvaravarṣaThen the bodhisatva named Kālarāja addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“In
this Saha universe (sahālokadhātu), son of good family, there are living beings
suffering from poverty (daridra), lacking food or drink (anannapāna), and wearing ragged
clothes; there are hungry ghosts (preta) tormented by hunger and thirst (kṣutpipāsā), covering
themselves with their hairs, and subsisting on such as spittle, mucus, blood, and pus
(kheṭasiṃhāṇarudhirapūya). In order to protect these living beings, please pour down the
rain of food, drink, and clothing!”Immediately after that, by the magical presence of the
bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the rain of all kinds of delicious hard foods, soft foods (khādanīyabhojanīya),
and soups poured down;the rain of all kinds of tasty beverages poured down to
the depth of a chariot’s axle (akṣamātrābhir dhārābhiḥ);the rain of many hundred thousand
colors of clothes, which are pleasant to touch like the thin and soft cloth (kācilindika),
poured down.Then, in this world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu),
all the wretched and poor (sarvakṛpaṇadaridra), and all hungry ghosts (sarvapreta)
were satisfied.
