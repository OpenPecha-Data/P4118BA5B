11. TyāgānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of renunciation, which is
authorized by the Lord for the sake of the bodhisatvas? (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya
buddhānujñātā tyāgānusmṛtiḥ)What we called renunciation (tyāga) is to abandon and renounce
any material thing (sarvopadhi).Why is that? There is not any dharma that is to be renounced,and
any dharma to be renounced does not appear.That which is not to be entangled
in any dharma (sarvadharmāgrahaṇa) is the highest renunciation;that which is not entangled
is without renunciation;that which is without renunciation is without haughtiness (amanyanatā);that
which is without haughtiness is without apprehending (anupalambha);that which is
without apprehending is without [mental] activity (apracāra);that which is without [mental]
activity is without information by thinking (cittāvijñapti);where there is no information
by thinking (cittāvijñāpti), there is no basis in consciousness (vijñānāniśraya);that
which is without basis in consciousness is the recollection of renunciation (tyāgānusmṛti)
authorized by the Lord.This renunciation of the bodhisatva is to transform into omniscience
(sarvajñapariṇāmana), and the omniscience is the same as all moments of existence (sarvadharmasamatā).Even
though staying in sameness (samatāsthita) he recollects renunciation;
even though he does not recollect any moment of existence, he transforms into awakening (bodhi).Why
is that?Since in omniscience (sarvajñatā) there is no duality of truth and untruth
(dharmādharma), the non-duality (advaya) is without any mental effort (manasikāra).In this
way, son of good family, the bodhisatva cultivating the knowledge of the Dharma (dharmajñānaprayukta)
practices the recollection of renunciation which is authorized by the Lord.
