AbhayadānaAt that time, there were five hundred men who were in danger of being killed [by robbers.]
When they were led to their death, a voice resonated in open space: “You should do
homage to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, who provides fearlessness (abhaya) to the frightened,
then you will be saved from death.”Then all those, terrified with the fear of death, said
together in one voice: “Homage to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (namo gaganagañjāya
bodhisatvāya mahāsatvāya)!”In that very moment, five hundred men, having descended
from the open space and arrived at that place, said this to robbers (vadhakapuruṣa):“Why
do you kill these poor men? Kill us, take our clothes and ornaments, and set them free.”Then
the robbers released the five hundred men to be killed because of vices caused by their
greed, and killed the magically created men.Then they, freed from the robbers, found
their relief (āśvāsana) from the fear and terror (bhayabhīṭa) of being killed, went to the
place where the bodhisatva Gaganagañja stayed, bowed down at the feet of the Buddha, joined
the palms of their hands (añjali), bowed to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, and said:“We survived
and found relief because of you, O Good man (satpuruṣa), please teach us the dharma
which is the entrance into development for myself and others, because one can make progress
in the dharma.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Sons of good family, you should conceive
the incomparable complete awakening (utpādayata idānīm anuttarāyāṃ samyakṣaṃbodhau cittam),
in this way, you can practice what is benefit for yourselves and for others (ātmahitaparahita).”Thus
addressed, they generated the thought of incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi),
and offered a hundred thousand calico clothes (duṣya) to the bodhisatva
Gaganagañja.Then, saying “Friends, let us also offer this calico clothes to the Lord,”
all those offered calico clothes for the body of the Lord.Thereupon the Lord prophesied:
“After incalculable aeons, when you achieved the way of the dharma which are wings of awakening
(sarvabodhipakṣikadharmanaya), all of you will appear in this world as the tathāgatas
called Abhayadāna.”
