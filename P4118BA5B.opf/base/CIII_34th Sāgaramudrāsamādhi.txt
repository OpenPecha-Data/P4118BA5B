34. SāgaramudrāsamādhiHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva become unattached to
all thoughts and deeds of living beings (sarvasatvacittacaritāsakta) when he obtains the
ocean seal samādhi (sāgaramudrāsamādhipratilabdha)?.Son of good family, as many as features
of living beings appear in the Jambudvipa World, the seal which is like all of them reflects
in the great ocean, thus it is called the great ocean (māhasāgara).In the same way, as
many as there are the appearance of thoughts (cittāvabhāsa), the appearance of forms (rūpāvabhāsa),
or the appearance of sounds (śabdāvabhāsa), all those reflect in a single appearance
(avabhāsa) of the bodhisatva who maintains the ocean seal samādhi, thus it is called
the ocean seal samādhi (sāgaramudrāsamādhi).Just as the great ocean is of a single taste
(ekarasa), so the dharma of the bodhisatva is also of a single taste since he knows the taste
of liberation (vimukirasa).Just as [the tide of] the great ocean is punctual, so the
bodhisatva is never late for the seat of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa) by investigating when is the
right time and wrong time.Just as the great ocean decomposes a rotting corpse (mahāsāgaro
mṛtakuṇapena sārdhaṃ saṃvasanti), so the bodhisatva breaks down any habitual pattern of
vices (sarvakleśavāsanā) or any thought of disciples and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhacitta).Just
as, no matter how much water in the great ocean is consumed, there
is no increase or decrease, just so, no matter how much the dharma is consumed, the sphere
of the dharma (dharmadhātu) of the bodhisatva is not increased or decreased.Just as the
width of the great ocean is immeasurable, so the insight (prajñā) of the bodhisatva is immeasurable.Just
as the depth of the great ocean is hard to fathom (duravagāha), so the profoundness
of the bodhisatva is hard for disciples and isolated buddhas to understand.Just as
the great ocean is the place of immeasurable living beings, so the maturing of immeasurable
living beings (satvaparipācana) depends on the bodhisatva.This is the entrance of the
ocean seal samādhi (sāgaramudrāsamādhipraveśa), and, son of good family, the bodhisatva who
enters into the way is not attached to the thoughts or deeds of any living being (sarvasatvacittacaritāsakta).
