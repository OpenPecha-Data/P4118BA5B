10. DharmānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of the Dharma, which is
authorized by the Lord for the sake of the bodhisatvas (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvānām
buddhānujñātā buddhānusmṛtiḥ)?.The Dharma is without attachment (arāga),and he who is attached
to any dharma is without the recollection of the Dharma.The Dharma is without basis
(anālaya),and where there is no the practice of the Dharma, there is no the recollection
of the Dharma.The Dharma is calm (upaśānta), and he whose thought and mind are burning (jvalana)
is without the recollection of the Dharma.The Dharma is beyond distinguishing marks
(animitta), and he who pursues distinguishing marks (nimittānusāra) is without the recollection
of the Dharma.The Dharma is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), and he who is dependent on
the conditioned place (saṃskṛtapratiṣṭhāpanapratiṣṭhita) is without the recollection of the
Dharma.Further, the recollection of the Dharma is to see the fact that there is no origination
of any conditioned thing (sarvasaṃskārānutpādadarśana), and to enter into faultless
reality (samyaktvaniyamapraveśa).The bodhisatva, knowing that all dharmas are not originated
because of their intrinsic nature (sarvadharmāṃ svabhāvānutpattiṃ viditvā), attains the
tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣāntipratilabdha).This state of
being is the true Dharma (bhūtadharma).He who understands thus understands all dharmas, since
it is the way in which the people on the path of training or on the path beyond training,
the isolated buddhas, the bodhisatvas, and the perfectly awakened one (śaikṣāśaikṣapratyekabuddhabodhisatvasamyaksaṃbuddha)
understand all dharmas.Such concentration (samāhita)
is the liberation of all the holy (sarvāryavimukti), and in that there is no involvement
with any dharma (sarvadharmāsamudācāra).The absence of involvement with any dharma is the
recollection of the Dharma, which is authorized by the Lord (buddhānujñāta).
