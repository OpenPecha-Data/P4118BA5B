37. SarvajñajñānaThose good men obtain the self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna), not being
dependent on the knowledge of others (jñānāparapraṇeya)..Why is that? This is because
they are dependent on the self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna), and do not seek the
knowledge of other beings (parasatvajñāna).When the bodhisatva does not depend on others,
obtains the self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna), and teaches the knowledge of determining
the dharma (dharmaviniścayajñānanirdeśa), then he immediately attains the knowledge
of omniscience (sarvajñajñāna).
