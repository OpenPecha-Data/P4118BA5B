The Bodhisatvas, the great beings had assembled from many different buddha-fields and they were
innumerable, endless, and inexpressible. With him was also a great assembly of ineffable
bodhisatvas. (nānābuddhakṣetrasaṃnipatitair bodhisatvamahāsatvāprameyāpramāṇābhilapyair
mahābhilapyabodhisatvagaṇena sārdhaṃ);skilled in transmigration through infinite buddha-field
in an instant (sarvacittakṣaṇikānantabuddhakṣetragatikuśalaiḥ);had always worshipped
the Tathāgatas, skilled in paying homage to [them](sarvatathāgatapūjopasthānakuśalair);sought
to receive teachings (atṛptadharmaparyeṣṭibhiḥ);constantly striving to throughly mature
all sentient beings (satatasamitaṃ sarvasatvaparipācanānuyuktaiḥ);attained the perfection
of the best skillful means and knowledge (prajñopāyaparamapāramitābhir);thoroughly established
in unobstructed emancipation (anāvaraṇamokṣapratiṣṭhitaiḥ);perfectly transcended all
mental constructions and conceptual consciousness (sarvakalpavikalpaprapañcasamatikrāntaiḥ);near
to the stage of omniscience. They were like this. (sarvajñajñānāsannībhūtais tad
yathā)The bodhisatva Vidyuddeva, the bodhisatva Yuddhajaya, the bodhisatva Vairocanagarbha,
the bodhisatva Parākramavikrama, the bodhisatva Vimatismudghātin, the bodihsatva Vighuṣṭaśabda,
the bodhisatva Vyavalokanacakṣur, the bodhisatva Vigatatamasā, (vidyuddena ca bodhisatvena

inconceivable, unequalled, incomparable bodhisatvas, the great beings (evaṃ pramukhair
asaṃkhyeyāprameyāpramāṇācintyāsamāmeyair bodhisatvair mahāsatvaiḥ).[they were] infinite,
ineffable, again ineffable (aprameyānabhilāpyānabhilāpyaiḥ sārdham);

II. Introduction

Then The Lord revealed the exposition of religion entitled the chapter of The Great Colleciton
to bodhisatvas, the great beings (atha khalu bhagavān mahāsaṃnipātaparivartaṃ nāma dharmaparyāyaṃ
bodhisatvānāṃ mahāsatvānāṃ prakāśayati sma mahāsaṃnipātaparivarte dharmaparyāye
nirdiśyamāne).Below is the reconstruction of the Dharmakṣema version as corresponding to
and based on Akṣ p. 17,6ff. There seems to be some, but fairly few differences from the Tibetan
Akṣ text as reconstructed into Sanskrit.atha khalu bhagavān bodhisatvacaryāpraveśaniryātyanāvaraṇamukhaṃ

vibhajayaty uttānīkaroti samprakāśayati sma.The whole assembly thought "I am sitting
in the pavilion in the vault of the sky (sarvāvatī parṣad aham gaganatale mahāvyūhakūṭāgārāntara
āsanna iti)."The display of these marvelous pavilions illuminated the sight of living
beings (teṣām eva kūṭāgārārāṇāṃ vyūhaḥ satvānāṃ darśanapathe ’vabhāsayati sma).Except
for the bodhisatvas, the great beings, the great disciples, the highest gods, snake-gods,
demons and celestial musicians who were seated in the pavilions, the rest of the beings in
this system of threefold thousand great thousands of worlds, appearing as a form, was eclipsed.
All of them thought "I am just like space." (kūṭāgāreṣu niṣaṇṇān bodhisatvān mahāsatvān
mahāśrāvakāṃś ca punar api devanāgayakṣagandharvān tān sarvān sthāpayitvā trisahasramahāsahasralokadhātuṣu
anavabhāsān abhūvann te 'pi gaganāsanna iti)As the empty space at the
end of the aeon, the manifestations of forms in the great three-thousand of worlds disappeared
from the sight of anyone (tadyathā kalpaparyavasāne gaganasamā bhavanti trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātuṣu
rūpāvabhāsā ye kecit anavabhāsā bhavanti tadā ye rūpāvabhāsāḥ satvebhyaḥ
darśanapathe anavabhāsitāḥ).These pavilions were illuminated like the pavilions which
bodhisatvas had stayed in the Mahāvyūha universe of the tathāgāta Ekaratnavyūha.Except for
those who were sitting in the pavilion in the sky, the rest of them in the great three-thousand
of worlds, staying on the surface of the earth, as far as its foundations, thought
that they had disappeared. Also the king of the mountain, Mt. Sumeru, Mt. Cakravāḍa, and
Mt. Mahācakravāḍa (parvatarājasumerucakravāḍamahācakravāḍa) disappeared from the sight of
living beings.Villages, towns, market-towns, royal cities, capitals (grāmanagaranigamarāṣṭrarājadhānī)
were also eclipsed. However, with the lion’s throne (simhāsana) of the Lord it
was another matter, they perceived it as shining ten thousand yojanas high as placed in
these pavilions placed in the vault of the sky.By the light of the lion’s throne on which
the Lord was seated, the great three-thousand thousands of worlds were illumined with a grand
lustre. The great three-thousand of worlds, the sun, the moon, the stars, Indra, Brahma,
and the the protectors of the world (trisahasramahāsahasralokadhātor candrasūryajyotiṣa
śakrabrahmalokapālānām avabhāsa), all of them were eclipsed (dhyāmīkṛta).When that whole
assembly of bodhisatvas saw these miracles, wonders, and amazing phenomena (prātihāryāścaryādbhuta),
they said to one another: “It would not be easy for us to see such an exceptional
grandeur as the splendor of this pavilion even if our lifetime would fill an aeon (kalpasthitikāyuḥpramāṇa).
Thus the virtues of these pavilions (kūṭāgārāṇāṃ guṇavyūhāḥ) are immeasurable.”
