Just as, son of good family (tadyathā kulaputra), empty space does not get burned in the destroying
fire at the end of a Kalpa (kalpoddāha) and is not flooded in the destruction by water
[at the end of an aeon] (apskandha), in such a way, the meditation of the bodhisatva
does not get burned by any affliction (sarvakleśa) and is not attached to the [four] meditations,
[eight] liberations, concentrations, and attainments of meditation (sarvadhyānavimokṣasamādhisamāpatti).[The
meditation of bodhisatva] establishes living beings with distracted
thoughts (vikṣiptacittā) in the state of concentration (samāhita).If he is in the state
of concentration, but ends up in an unpleasant situation, he is not irritated (apratihata).Even
thought he always manifests peacefulness (upaśānta) to noble beings (āryajana), he
makes flaming efforts (dīptavīrya) in order to bring ordinary people (anāryajana) to maturity.Being
in the state of sameness in concentration (samāhitasamatā), he still teaches those
with irregular behaviour (asamacaryā) by means of various kinds of teachings.He does
not see the irregular (asama) in terms of sameness (samatā), and he does not obstruct (virudhyate)
the irregular (asama) with sameness (samatā).Since he is unobstructed (aviruddha),
he is called the meditator (dhyāyin) whose thought is just like open space (gaganasamacitta),
without any obstruction;he is called a meditator with great insight (mahāprajña);he
is called the meditator who is not dependent on consciousness (vijñānāpratiṣṭhita).When meditation
is understood in this way, then the meditation of the bodhisatva is like the expanse
of open space (gaganasama), which is not dependent on anything (apratiṣṭhitadhyāna).
