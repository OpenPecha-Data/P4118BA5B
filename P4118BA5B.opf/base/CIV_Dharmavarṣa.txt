Dharmavarṣa no dharnavarṣa sectionThen the bodhisatva named Samantāloka thought like this:Does
this magical arrangement (vyūha) of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja exist only in this world,
or in other world-spheres as well?The bodhisatva Gaganagañja, knowing telepathically the
thought of the bodhisatva Samatāloka, said to him (atha gaganagañjo bodhisatvo bodhisatvasya
samatālokasya cetasā cetaḥparivitarkam ājñāya bodhisatvaṃ samatālokam etad avocat):“Son
of good family, if you gain the divine sight (divyacakṣur) which is completely clear and
pure, son of good family, you can look at whatever can be seen in the world-spheres of ten
directions (daśadiglokadhātu).”Then when the bodhisatva Samantāloka examined the world-spheres
of ten directions by the divine sight, in immeasurable and incalculable Buddha-fields
of the ten directions, just as the rain of all kinds of jewels poured down and all voices
of the dharma resounded in this Sahā universe, just so in those Buddha-fields he saw that
such phenomena occurred without increasing or decreasing, and without entering into any
difference.Then the bodhisatva Samantāloka, having been astonished (āścaryaprāpta), uttered
a joyous utterance (udānam udānayati): “The accomplishment of the magical presence (adhiṣṭhāna)
of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s vow (praṇidhāna) is inconceivable (acintya).O Good
man (satpuruṣa), please pure down a rain like this on all the buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra)
immediately.”Then, by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva) and the magical presence
of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the whole assembly saw the rain of jewels (ratnavarṣa) and
the rain of the dharma (dharmavarṣa) pouring down on those buddha-fields.By this miracle (prātihārya),
the rain of jewels (ratnavarṣa) and the rain of the dharma (dharmavarṣa), performed
by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, immeasurable beings (gaṇanāsamatikrāntasatva) produced
the thought of awakening (samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni).
