Son of good family, how does the knowledge of the bodhisatva becomes like open space (kathaṃ
kulaputra bodhisatvasya jñānaṃ gaganasamam)?Having pervaded the thoughts of all beings (sarvasatvacitta)
by knowledge (jñāna), he knows the impassioned thought of all beings truly
as it is, as an impassioned thought (sarvasatvacittaṃ sarāgaṃ cittam api sarāgaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ
prajānāti);he knows the thought full of aversion truly as it is, as a thought full
of aversion (sadoṣaṃ cittam api sadoṣaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti);he knows the thought
full of bewilderment truly as it is, as a thought full of bewilderment (samohaṃ cittam
api samohaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti);he knows the thought full of impurity truly as
it is, as a thought full of impurity (sopakleśaṃ cittaṃ api sopakleśaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ
prajānāti);he never deviates from (avicalita) the nature of all moments of existence (dharmāprakṛti)
which is without desire (rāga), and teaches religion for other beings (parasatvapudgala)
so that they overcome their desire;he never deviates from the nature of all moments
of existence which is without aversion (dveṣa), and teaches religion for other beings
so that they overcome their aversion;he never deviates from the nature of all moments of
existence which is without bewilderment (moha), and teaches religion for other beings so that
they overcome their bewilderment;he never deviates from the nature of all moments of existence
which is without impurity (upakleśa), and teaches religion for other beings so that
they overcome their impurity;he teaches religion in order to purify the vices of desire,
aversion, and bewilderment (rāgadveṣamohakleśa);he never looks down on the thought of desire,
aversion, bewilderment, and impurity (rāgadveṣamohopakleśa); and he also never looks
up to the thought free from desire, aversion, bewilderment, and impurity.Why is that? Because
bodhisatva understands the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu) from the
viewpoint of non-duality (advaya), in the way that the sphere of all moments of existence
is the same as the sphere of desire (rāgadhātu); the sphere of all moments of existence is
the sphere of aversion (dveṣadhātu); the sphere of all moments of existence is the sphere
of bewilderment (mohadhātu); the sphere of all moments of existence is the sphere of vices
(kleśadhātu).For that reason, since all moments of existence are called the gathering of
the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātusamavasaraṇa), there is no going or no
not-going in the sphere of all moments of existence;and since all moments of existence belong
to the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātvanugata), he who knows the sphere
of self (ātmadhātu) also knows the sphere of all moments of existence.Thus the sphere of
all moments of existence and the sphere of self are not two (advaya).Why is that? Because
the self is pure (ātmaviśuddhi), the sphere of all moments of existence is also pure (dharmadhātuviśuddhi).In
that way all moments of existence are pure, and this purity is illumination;the
illumination is without any upper cover (ābhyavakāśika);where there is no upper
cover (ābhyavakāśika), there is no space (avakāśa) for any distinguishing marks (nimitta);where
there are no distinguishing marks (animitta) there is no basis at all, and being without
any basis is the same as open space.In that way he is in accordance with knowledge,
and because of the knowledge, he is also in accordance with all moments of existence. That
is the knowledge of the bodhisatva becoming like open space.
