What then is the purification of memory (tatra katamā dhāraṇīpariśodhanā)?Son of good family,
there are thirty-two purifications of memory. What are the thirty-two?To wit, seeking the
dharma (dharmārthikatā);delight in the dharma (dharmakāmatā);taking pleasure in the delights
of the dharma (dharmārāmaratiratatā);inclination towards the dharma (dharmanimnatā);disposition
to the dharma (dharmaprāgbhāratā);honoring, serving, and worshiping the learned
(bahuśrutān sevate bhajate paryupāste);paying respect to teachers and preceptors without
pride (ācāryopādhyāyeṣu nirmānagurugauravatā);non-satisfaction in searching for the dharma
(dharmaparyeṣṭyatṛptatā);adequatly grasping gentle speech according to admonitions (anuśāsanīṣu
suvacaḥpradakṣiṇagrahitā);never looking for the preachers’ mistakes, considering them
as the teachings [of the Buddha];memorizing and reciting [the teachings];no laziness concerning
the teaching (deṣanāyāṃ akauśīdyatā);no secrecy of teachers concerning religion (dharme
’nācāryamuṣṭiḥ);giving the gift of religion without a view to profit (nirāmiṣadharmadānatā);hearing
on the basis of the root of insight (prajñāmūlapratisthānaśrutatā);practicing

and remaining in a solitary place (nityacittavivekanimnatā);recollecting the six

into what is to be done (karmakāryāvatāra);no fear reflecting on thoughts concerning
the three gates of liberation (trivimokṣamukheṣu cittanidhyaptyanuttrāsatā);never cutting
off the [fourfold] sources of holiness (āryavaṃśa) by possessing the qualities of purity
(dhūtaguṇa);no despondency to uphold the true religion (apagatalīnacittasaddharmaparigrahatā);great
compassion with regard for living beings (satvāvekṣaṇatayā mahākaruṇā);giving

beings (satvaparipācanayām aparikhedatā).These are the purification of memory.
