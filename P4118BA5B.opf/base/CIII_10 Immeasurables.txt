Through these ten immeasurables (daśāpramāṇa), son of good family, the bodhisatva completes
(paripūrayati) the accumulations of merit (puṇyasaṃbhāra). What are these ten (katame daśa)?a)
completion (paripūraṇā) of the immeasurable ornaments for the body (kāyālaṃkāra) by fulfilling
the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty (lakṣaṇānuvyañjanaparipūraṇa);b)
completion of the immeasurable ornaments of speech (vāgālaṃkāra) by purifying
his sphere of speech (svaramaṇḍala) so it is in accordance with all beings (sarvasatvānugatasvaramaṇḍalaviśuddhi);c)
completion of the immeasurable ornaments for thought (cittālaṃkāra)
in accordance with the thought of all beings (sarvasatvacittānuvartanatā);d) completion
of the immeasurable maturation (pariṇāmanā) of living beings through immeasurable behaviour
(īryāpatha) of practice and knowledge;e) completion of the immeasurable purity of Buddha-fields
(buddhakṣetra) through immeasurable forms (ākāra);f) completion of the immeasurable
behaviour of the Buddha (buddheryāpatha) by infinitely reflecting (nidhyāna) and pondering
on the thought of merits;g) completion of the immeasurable embellishment of the place
of awakening (bodhimaṇḍālaṃkāra) through all practices (sarvacaryā) with all arrangements
of the ornaments (sarvālaṃkāravyūha);h) completion of the immeasurable enjoyment (paribhoga)
of the circle of hair between the eyebrows (ūrṇa) by accumulating endless offerings (anantayajña);i)
completion of the immeasurable, invisible crown of the head (anavalokitamūrdha)
by serving teachers (guru) with endless homage and conquering pride (nihatamāna);j)
completion of the immeasurable unfailing courage (amoghavikrānti) by adequately grasping (pradakṣiṇagraha)
the coming and going (āgatigati) without deception or guile (māyāśāṭhya);Through
those ten immeasurables (daśāpramāṇa), son of good family, the bodhisatva accumulates
the collection of merit (puṇyasaṃbhāra).Furthermore, son of good family, when the thought
of the bodhisatva becomes like open space, all his undertakings (sarvārambha) are infinitely
established everywhere since open space is infinite, and thus it is called merit like
open space (gaganasamapuṇya).

8. Jñāna

Son of good family, how does the knowledge of the bodhisatva becomes like open space (kathaṃ
kulaputra bodhisatvasya jñānaṃ gaganasamam)?Having pervaded the thoughts of all beings (sarvasatvacitta)
by knowledge (jñāna), he knows the impassioned thought of all beings truly
as it is, as an impassioned thought (sarvasatvacittaṃ sarāgaṃ cittam api sarāgaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ
prajānāti);he knows the thought full of aversion truly as it is, as a thought full
of aversion (sadoṣaṃ cittam api sadoṣaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti);he knows the thought
full of bewilderment truly as it is, as a thought full of bewilderment (samohaṃ cittam
api samohaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti);he knows the thought full of impurity truly as
it is, as a thought full of impurity (sopakleśaṃ cittaṃ api sopakleśaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ
prajānāti);he never deviates from (avicalita) the nature of all moments of existence (dharmāprakṛti)
which is without desire (rāga), and teaches religion for other beings (parasatvapudgala)
so that they overcome their desire;he never deviates from the nature of all moments
of existence which is without aversion (dveṣa), and teaches religion for other beings
so that they overcome their aversion;he never deviates from the nature of all moments of
existence which is without bewilderment (moha), and teaches religion for other beings so that
they overcome their bewilderment;he never deviates from the nature of all moments of existence
which is without impurity (upakleśa), and teaches religion for other beings so that
they overcome their impurity;he teaches religion in order to purify the vices of desire,
aversion, and bewilderment (rāgadveṣamohakleśa);he never looks down on the thought of desire,
aversion, bewilderment, and impurity (rāgadveṣamohopakleśa); and he also never looks
up to the thought free from desire, aversion, bewilderment, and impurity.Why is that? Because
bodhisatva understands the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu) from the
viewpoint of non-duality (advaya), in the way that the sphere of all moments of existence
is the same as the sphere of desire (rāgadhātu); the sphere of all moments of existence is
the sphere of aversion (dveṣadhātu); the sphere of all moments of existence is the sphere
of bewilderment (mohadhātu); the sphere of all moments of existence is the sphere of vices
(kleśadhātu).For that reason, since all moments of existence are called the gathering of
the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātusamavasaraṇa), there is no going or no
not-going in the sphere of all moments of existence;and since all moments of existence belong
to the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātvanugata), he who knows the sphere
of self (ātmadhātu) also knows the sphere of all moments of existence.Thus the sphere of
all moments of existence and the sphere of self are not two (advaya).Why is that? Because
the self is pure (ātmaviśuddhi), the sphere of all moments of existence is also pure (dharmadhātuviśuddhi).In
that way all moments of existence are pure, and this purity is illumination;the
illumination is without any upper cover (ābhyavakāśika);where there is no upper
cover (ābhyavakāśika), there is no space (avakāśa) for any distinguishing marks (nimitta);where
there are no distinguishing marks (animitta) there is no basis at all, and being without
any basis is the same as open space.In that way he is in accordance with knowledge,
and because of the knowledge, he is also in accordance with all moments of existence. That
is the knowledge of the bodhisatva becoming like open space.

9. BuddhānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of the Buddha, which is authorized
by the Lord for bodhisatvas? (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā
buddhānusmṛtiḥ).a) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of morality (śīla),
he never gives up (asaṃpramoṣata) unsullied morality (anāsravaśīla);b) while recollecting
the Buddha in the perspective concentration (samādhi), he is changeless (nirvikāra) concerning
the sphere of the moments of existence (dharmadhātu) being always same;c) while recollecting
the Buddha from the perspective of insight (prajñā), he is free from thought-constructions
(nirvikalpa) since there is no activity in all moments of existence (sarvadharmāpracāra);d)
while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of liberation (vimukti), he
does not stay in the secondary-thought (dvitīyacitta);e) while recollection the Buddha from
the perspective of the vision of the knowledge of liberation (vimuktijñānadarśana), he
is not attached (asakta) to any knowledge (sarvajñāna);f) while recollecting the Buddha from
the perspective of power (bala), he is not moving (āniñjya) concerning the knowledge which
is equanimous in all three times (tryadhvasamata);g) while recollecting the Buddha from
the perspective of fearlessness (vaiśāradya), he does not stay with any defilement (sarvāsravaḥ
sārdhaṃ na saṃvasati);h) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of all
qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma), he does not have any false discrimination in
the sameness of the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātusamatāṃ na vikalpayati).Furthermore,
the recollection of the Buddha is not to see (na samanupaśyati) the Lord from
his material body (rūpasvabhāva), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection
through understanding the nature of the material form;it is not to see the Lord from
his feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna),
but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection through understanding their nature;it
is not to see the Lord from his parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception
(skandhadhātvāyatana), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection through
understanding their nature.Again, since he understands the essence of all moments of
existence (sarvadharmasvabhāvajñānena), the recollection of the great insight (mahāprajñānusmṛti)
is beyond any mental effort (sarvamanasikāra) and the arising (paryuttāna) of any
viewpoint (sarvadṛṣṭi);Since in this way recollection is pure (anāvila), the knowledge of
the application of awareness (smṛtyupsthānajñāna) is called the recollection of the Buddha
which is taught by the Lord.Further, the recollection of the Buddha is not to be attached
to any of the Lord’s ways of behavior (sarveryapatha), to wit: standing (sthita), walking
(caṃkrama), sitting (niṣadya), sleeping (śayana), going (gati), coming (āgati), speaking
(pravyāhāra), and not speaking (apravyāhāra).Since there is no attachment, he does not recollect
recollection nor recollect non-recollection.Since there is no mental effort in recollection
(asmṛtimanasikāra), he does not recollect the Buddha in the perspective of form,
distinguishing marks or any state of things (rūpalakṣaṇadharmatā).There is no involvement
with any distinguishing mark or object (sarvanimittālambanāsamudācāra), son of good family,
this is therefore the recollection of the Buddha, which is authorized by the Lord.

10. DharmānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of the Dharma, which is
authorized by the Lord for the sake of the bodhisatvas (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvānām
buddhānujñātā buddhānusmṛtiḥ)?.The Dharma is without attachment (arāga),and he who is attached
to any dharma is without the recollection of the Dharma.The Dharma is without basis
(anālaya),and where there is no the practice of the Dharma, there is no the recollection
of the Dharma.The Dharma is calm (upaśānta), and he whose thought and mind are burning (jvalana)
is without the recollection of the Dharma.The Dharma is beyond distinguishing marks
(animitta), and he who pursues distinguishing marks (nimittānusāra) is without the recollection
of the Dharma.The Dharma is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), and he who is dependent on
the conditioned place (saṃskṛtapratiṣṭhāpanapratiṣṭhita) is without the recollection of the
Dharma.Further, the recollection of the Dharma is to see the fact that there is no origination
of any conditioned thing (sarvasaṃskārānutpādadarśana), and to enter into faultless
reality (samyaktvaniyamapraveśa).The bodhisatva, knowing that all dharmas are not originated
because of their intrinsic nature (sarvadharmāṃ svabhāvānutpattiṃ viditvā), attains the
tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣāntipratilabdha).This state of
being is the true Dharma (bhūtadharma).He who understands thus understands all dharmas, since
it is the way in which the people on the path of training or on the path beyond training,
the isolated buddhas, the bodhisatvas, and the perfectly awakened one (śaikṣāśaikṣapratyekabuddhabodhisatvasamyaksaṃbuddha)
understand all dharmas.Such concentration (samāhita)
is the liberation of all the holy (sarvāryavimukti), and in that there is no involvement
with any dharma (sarvadharmāsamudācāra).The absence of involvement with any dharma is the
recollection of the Dharma, which is authorized by the Lord (buddhānujñāta).

10. SaṃghānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection on the Saṃgha, which is
authorized by the Lord for the sake of the bodhisatvas (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya
saṃghānujñātā buddhānusmṛtiḥ)?.What we called the Saṃgha is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta),
and it cannot to be recollected in the perspective of conditioning (abhisaṃskāra).Where there
is no involvement (samudācāra) with the actions of body, speech or mind (kāyavāṅmanaskarma),
it is called unconditioned (anabhisaṃskāra).Thus what we called conditioned (saṃskṛta)
is a mere denomination (prajñapti) and convention (vyavahāra);The unconditioned (asaṃskṛta)
is the destruction of all denominations (sarvaprajñaptisamudghāta), and the transcendence
of all conventions (sarvavyavahārasamatikrānta).Son of good family, this is the recollection
of the congregation, which is authorized by the Lord.

11. TyāgānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of renunciation, which is
authorized by the Lord for the sake of the bodhisatvas? (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya
buddhānujñātā tyāgānusmṛtiḥ)What we called renunciation (tyāga) is to abandon and renounce
any material thing (sarvopadhi).Why is that? There is not any dharma that is to be renounced,and
any dharma to be renounced does not appear.That which is not to be entangled
in any dharma (sarvadharmāgrahaṇa) is the highest renunciation;that which is not entangled
is without renunciation;that which is without renunciation is without haughtiness (amanyanatā);that
which is without haughtiness is without apprehending (anupalambha);that which is
without apprehending is without [mental] activity (apracāra);that which is without [mental]
activity is without information by thinking (cittāvijñapti);where there is no information
by thinking (cittāvijñāpti), there is no basis in consciousness (vijñānāniśraya);that
which is without basis in consciousness is the recollection of renunciation (tyāgānusmṛti)
authorized by the Lord.This renunciation of the bodhisatva is to transform into omniscience
(sarvajñapariṇāmana), and the omniscience is the same as all moments of existence (sarvadharmasamatā).Even
though staying in sameness (samatāsthita) he recollects renunciation;
even though he does not recollect any moment of existence, he transforms into awakening (bodhi).Why
is that?Since in omniscience (sarvajñatā) there is no duality of truth and untruth
(dharmādharma), the non-duality (advaya) is without any mental effort (manasikāra).In this
way, son of good family, the bodhisatva cultivating the knowledge of the Dharma (dharmajñānaprayukta)
practices the recollection of renunciation which is authorized by the Lord.

12. ŚīlānusmṛtiSon of good family, how does the recollection of morality of bodhisatva becomes
like open space (tatra kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā śīlānusmṛtir gaganasamā)?.What
we called ‘morality (śīla)’ is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), unsullied (anāsrava),
no wishful thinking (apraṇidhāna), effortless (anābhoga), and it accomplishes vows (siddhavrata),
fulfils the vows (vrataparipūri), and does not have essential characteristic of
information (vijñaptilakṣaṇa).Since it is established by concentration (samādhi), it is not
established in the object of thought (cittopalaṃbha).Since it is the root of insight (prajñāmūla),
it is without essential characteristic of discursive thinking (niḥprapañcalakṣaṇa).Since
it is the outcome of liberation (vimuktiniṣyanda), it is not distinguished by duality
(advayaprabhāvita).Since there is no visual form, it is praised by the wise (pāṇḍitapraśaṃsita).Since
it appeases vices (kleśapraśamana), there is no essential characteristic
of recognition (aprativijñaptilakṣaṇa).Since it is in accordance with all happiness (sarvasukhānugata)
and is not generated by the contrary (pratipakṣaprabhāvita), while recollecting
this morality, there is no impurity (anāvila) in the recollection. Son of good family,
this is what is called the recollection of morality which is authorized by the Lord (sa kulaputra
bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā śīlānusmṛtiḥ).

12. DevānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of gods, which is authorized
by the Lord for bodhisatvas (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā devānusmṛtiḥ)?.It
is the recollection of two assemblies of gods (devanikāya). What are these two
(katame dve)?The gods of the Pure Abode (śuddhāvāsadeva), and the bodhisatvas hindered by
only one birth (ekajātipratibaddhabodhisatva), who dwell in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha).In
that the bodhisatva recollects the gods of the Pure Abode (śuddhāvāsadeva).Further,
the bodhisatvas who are hindered by only one birth (ekajātipratibaddhabodhisatva), and
who dwell in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha) recollect ten qualities as the summit
(mūrdhan). What are those ten qualities?
