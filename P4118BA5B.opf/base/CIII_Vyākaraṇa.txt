VyākaraṇaWhen this decisive teaching was declared, seventy-two millions of gods, humans, asuras,
kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and other beings produced the thought of incomparable complete awakening
(iha dharmaniścaye nirdiśyamāne dvisaptatidevamānuṣāsurakinnaramahoragaprāṇiniyutānām
anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni);thirty-two thousand bodhisatvas attained
the tolerance that all things are unborn (dvātriṃśatīnāṃ ca bodhisatvasahasrāṇām anutpattikadharmakṣāntiḥ
pratilabdhā);this world system of three thousandfold worlds was shaken
in its six ways (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātuś ca ṣaḍvikāraḥ prakampito abhūt);and the
world was illuminated by a grand lustre (avabhāsa).A hundred thousand gods, having let fall
the rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa) and played the celestial cymbals (tūrya), uttered a joyous
utterance (udānam udānayati): “Living beings who, having heard this teaching, believe
it, embrace it, practice it, and proceed to the realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya).All the
Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra), where the Awakened Lords appear, are adorned with ornaments
and respected by the wise.Why is that? When the Buddhas appear, such dharma will be taught,
and the good men (satpurṣa) endowed with inconceivable qualities (acintyadharma) will see
it.”Then the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja, having heard the Buddha’s prediction
(vyākaraṇa), being delighted, offered to the body of the Buddha with a net of pearls (muktājāla)
having an immaculate and pure radiance (vimalaviśuddhaprabha) with the value of
pearls filling the three thousandfold world-system, and then he addressed himself to the
Lord:“The knowledge of the Awakened Lords is free from any attachment or obstruction; his
teaching is without interruption; and the Tathāgata sees the thoughts of all living beings
and is skilled in knowing the superior or inferior abilities of them (indriyavarāvarajñāna).Since
the Lord teaches such guiding principle of the dharma (dharmanaya), all congregations
are satisfied,the great vehicle (mahāyāna) is praised,and the bodhisatvas, having been
assembled from the worlds of ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu), were praised with this great
light of the dharma.Since the Lord Tathāgata teaches the entrance into the dharma (dharmamukha)
to us, based on the entrance into the source of the dharma, we will teach the immeasurable
entrance into the dharma.
