23. Pratītyasamutpādagaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 3Son of good family, how does the bodhisatva
become skilled in knowing the entrance into the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala),
and become free from two extreme views (sarvāntadvayadṛṣṭivivarjita)?.Son
of good family, the bodhisatva should think like this (iha bodhisatvasyaivaṃ bhavati):that
on which there is dependence, that is nothing in particular (yat pratītya tat kiṃcin
nāsti);that on which there is dependence, that is inexistent (yat pratītya so ’bhāvaḥ);that
on which there is dependence, that is not being established in reality (yat pratītya
tad apariniṣpannam);that on which there is dependent origination, that is impermanence, suffering,
selflessness and quiescence (yat pratītyasaṃutpannaṃ tad anityaduḥkhānātmaśāntam);in
the dependent origination, there is no self, no being, no life-principle, no life-sustaining
principle, no spirit, no personality, no human being, no man (na satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);in
the dependent origination there is no attainment (samudgama);in the
dependent origination there is nothing, and it is effortless (avyāyāma), empty (śūnya),
no distinguishing mark (animitta), transcendent (viveka), no activity (apracāra), no discursive
thinking (aprapañca), and thus beyond discursive thinking (niṣprapañca).Thus origination
(jāti) is just the arising of the dharma, and cessation (nirodha) is also the ceasing
of the dharma.Therefore it is said that there is no self, being, life-principle, life-sustaining
principle, spirit, personality, human being, or man (satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);In
the dharmas which are dependently originated there is no true origination (jāti)
and there is no owner (svāmika).Because of that, all dharmas are like grass, trees,
walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsasadṛśa).Just as there is nothing
that produces external things when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases
external things when they cease, just so, there is nothing that produces internal things
when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases internal things when they cease;But
rather, when conditions (pratyaya) exist they will arise, and when conditions are completely
exhausted they will be destroyed.”If you understand this knowledge in that way,
you will overcome any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).What then are extreme views (antadṛṣṭi)?‘Extreme
(anta)’ means discontinuity (uccheda) and continuity (nitya), and that which is
not originated and ceased is beyond discontinuity and continuity and thus pure, and therefore
it is purified when concerned with any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).In that way, son of
good family, the bodhisatva becomes skilled in knowing the entrance into the dependent origination
(pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala) and free from any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).
