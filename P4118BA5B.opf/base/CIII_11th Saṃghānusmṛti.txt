10. SaṃghānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection on the Saṃgha, which is
authorized by the Lord for the sake of the bodhisatvas (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya
saṃghānujñātā buddhānusmṛtiḥ)?.What we called the Saṃgha is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta),
and it cannot to be recollected in the perspective of conditioning (abhisaṃskāra).Where there
is no involvement (samudācāra) with the actions of body, speech or mind (kāyavāṅmanaskarma),
it is called unconditioned (anabhisaṃskāra).Thus what we called conditioned (saṃskṛta)
is a mere denomination (prajñapti) and convention (vyavahāra);The unconditioned (asaṃskṛta)
is the destruction of all denominations (sarvaprajñaptisamudghāta), and the transcendence
of all conventions (sarvavyavahārasamatikrānta).Son of good family, this is the recollection
of the congregation, which is authorized by the Lord.
